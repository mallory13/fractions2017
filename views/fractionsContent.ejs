        <h3><strong>Research Story</strong></h3>
        <p>In this fractions action research project, gaining a deeper understanding of the various misconceptions
          of fractions allowed teachers to better understand and respond to student thinking.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="row padding-bottom">
        <p>The part-whole relationship of simple fractions is highly emphasized across North American
          mathematics programs. Most students involved in this project demonstrated a consistently solid
          understanding of a half of an item, and when presented in the context of sharing food, also
          identified the need for the two pieces to be of equal size or area. This comfort level was evident
          when working with students to explore common benchmark fractions, such as <abbr title="one third" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>3</sub></span></abbr>
          and <abbr title="three quarters" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>3</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>4</sub></span></abbr>. However,
          when asked to represent less common fractions, such as <abbr title="two fifths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>2</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>5</sub></span></abbr> or to interpret the fraction
          <abbr title="six sixths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>6</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>6</sub></span></abbr>, many grade
          4 through 7 students struggled. Through this research project it was evident that students
          switched indiscriminately between the use of:
          <ul>
            <li>fractions as part of a whole using a set representation,</li>
            <li>fractions as part of a whole using an area representation, and</li>
            <li>fractions as a ratio (part-part)</li>
          </ul>
          These meanings and representations of fractions occur throughout the elementary and secondary Ontario curriculum.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="row padding-bottom">
        <p>Researchers have identified multiple ways of understanding, perceiving and representing
          fractions (Lamon, 1999; Marshall, 1993; Mosely & Okamoto, 2007). This research informed the
          development of the Math for Teaching: Ways We Use Fractions document, which highlights
          multiple interpretations and representations of a fraction depending on the context or situation.
          These include interconnected understandings of fractions as:
          <ul>
            <li>Linear Measures: situations in which a rational number's distance from zero is important</li>
            <li>Part-Whole Relationships: situations in which a part is compared to the total amount</li>
            <li>Part-Part Relationships: ratio situations in which separate quantities are compared</li>
            <li>Quotient perceptions: situations that highlight the process or result of a division</li>
            <li>Operator perceptions: situations in which the role of a rational number in enlarging or shrinking a quantity is highlighted</li>
          </ul>

        <p>The junior grades represent a key learning period for students with respect to fractions as they
          move beyond part-whole with continuous models to work with sets as well as part-part
          relationships. Within the junior curriculum, students are expected to be able to represent,
          compare, and order fractions. The development of these actions K-12 is shown and further
          explored below.</p>

        <h3>Representing</h3>
        <p><strong>Representing</strong> refers to the process of using symbolic, concrete and pictorial representations as
          well as words and relevant situations to explore concepts and communicate understanding.
          There are three general models that Watanabe (2002) illustrates for representations of fractions:
          linear (number lines), area (partitioned regions), and discrete (set models).</p>

        <p><em>Note; Within the Ontario curriculum (2005), symbolic notation (e.g. <abbr title="two thirds" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>2</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>3</sub></span></abbr>) is
            introduced formally in grade 4. Prior to this, familiarity fraction terminology such as halves, fourths, fifths supports student understanding</em></p>
      </section>

      <section class="row padding-bottom">
        <p>Research Findings:<br />
          Existing literature and the findings of this this fractions research project indicates that students
          should be exposed to number lines and rectangular area models in early grades. These
          representations support students in understanding the notion that a fraction is a number (for example <abbr title="one thirds" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>3</sub></span></abbr> is a number) as
          well
          as enable students to create equal partitions using a variety of
          strategies. Students frequently make incorrect conclusions when comparing fractions that are
          close in value using a circle model (such as <abbr title="four tenths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>4</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>10</sub></span></abbr> and <abbr title="one third" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>3</sub></span></abbr>
          ) as it is difficult to accurately partition a
          circle into ten equal-sized parts. Flexibility and purposefulness with representations enables
          students to make selections most appropriate to the context (such as a number line for distance).</p>
      </section>

      <section class="row padding-bottom">
        <h3>Comparing</h3>
        <p><strong>Comparing</strong> requires students to determine which fraction is the larger or the smaller.
          Comparing fractions assumes that the two fractions have the same whole, so is based in the part
          to whole meaning of fractions. Students should understand a fraction as a number and use
          benchmarks, such as 0, 1, <abbr title="one half" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>2</sub></span></abbr>, and <abbr title="three quarters" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>3</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>4</sub></span></abbr>
          to compare fractions. There are a variety of strategies for
          comparing fractions beyond determining a common denominator, including consideration of the
          relationship between the numerator and denominator. For example, students could quickly
          compare 1<abbr title="one hudred thirty four over two thousand twenty five" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>134</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>2025</sub></span></abbr>
          and 1<abbr title="one thousand nine hundred sixty three over two thousand" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1963</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>2000</sub></span></abbr> by realizing that the first fraction is closer to 1 since
          there
          is a greater difference between the numerator and denominator than in the second fraction. Older students
          may use their knowledge of fraction as a quotient to determine decimal equivalencies for
          comparison</p>
      </section>

      <section class="row padding-bottom">
        <p>Research Findings: <br /> IN this fractions research projects, students frequently doubled the numerators and denominator of a fractions
          to generate equivalent fractions but demonstrated little understanding of how this procedure connects to the repeated partitioning of a measure,
          such as area (<abbr title="one quarter" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>4</sub></span></abbr> = <abbr title="two eigthts" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>2</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>8</sub></span></abbr>
          or

          <div class="col-md-3">
            <!--image-->
          </div>
          ). Many students did not have consistent success with determining equivalent fractions by merging, pieces such as <abbr title="eighteen thirtysixths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>18</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>36</sub></span></abbr>
          = <abbr title="nine eighteenths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>9</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>18</sub></span></abbr>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="row padding-bottom">
        <h3>Ordering</h3>
        <p><strong>Ordering</strong> refers to the process of determining the relative size of a number of fractions by
          placing them in order from smallest to largest or largest to smallest. Students used their
          understanding of fractions to compare and order fractions in a variety of manners. Ordering
          fractions on a number line requires students to consider the magnitude of the fraction in
          comparison to whole numbers, benchmark fractions, and the other fractions they have placed on
          their number line. This relative comparison engages students in reasoning and proving with each
          successive placement, allowing them to correct previous errors as necessary.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="row padding-bottom">
        <p>Research Findings: <br />In the fractions research project, students who developed a deep conceptual understanding of
          fractions and flexible processes for comparing fractions were able to successfully order fractions
          on a number line using a variety of strategies. This extended to decimals, percents, and mixed
          numbers. </p>

                    Rich professional learning opportunities such as collaborative action research support teachers in recognizing the value of deep conceptual understanding. Educators in the project were able
                    to explore new instructional strategies and felt better able to support students and respond to their needs in the moment. Students too were excited to be a part of the project and benefited in their learning
                    as a result of the focus on fractions.
