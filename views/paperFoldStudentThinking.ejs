                Teacher: Sure.
                Student 1: I folded it into three and then I folded that into three so that is nine. Yeah.
                Teacher: What did you fold into three?
                Student 1: This. I don’t know I folded this piece of paper into three and then I took that length and I folded it into another three and I got nine.

                Teacher: How are you folding your strip into ninths? What did you do?
                Student 2: I am folding them like a fan.
                Teacher: OK. How did you know where to start?
                Student 2: At the 22 mm and then I started folding back and forth cause if you fold like this they start getting bigger every time (showing a ‘roll’ fold).
                Teacher: So by going back and forth in a fan design, you keep them as accurate as possible?
                Student 2: Yeah.
                Teacher: I will be interested to see what it looks like at the end.
                Student 2: And it ends up (unfolding it).
                Teacher: Do you want to check to make sure?
                Student 2: (placing alongside ruler) One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten.
