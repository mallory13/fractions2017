    <p><em>Paying Attention to Mathematics Education</em> provided an overview of what it would take to help Ontario students make – and sustain – gains in their learning and understanding of mathematics. It outlined seven foundational principles
      for planning and implementing improvements and gave examples of what each principle would involve.</p>
    <p>This document focuses on the mathematical content area of fractions. Key findings from Ontario research are used throughout the document to connect the learning and teaching of fractions from K to 12. This document serves to spark discussion
      and learning about this important topic. Future support documents will explore other key topics in mathematics teaching and learning.</p>

    <h3>Why Is Understanding Fractions Important?</h3>
    <blockquote class="blockquote color-lil">
      <em>No area of elementary school mathematics is as mathematically rich, cognitively complicated, and difficult to teach as fractions, ratios, and proportionality. These ideas all express mathematical relationships: fractions and ratios are
        ‘relational’ numbers. They are the first place in which students encounter numerals like ‘ 34 ’ that represent relationships between two discrete or continuous quantities, rather than a single discrete (‘three apples’) or continuous quantity
        (‘4 inches of rope’).</em>
      <footer>Litwiller & Bright, 2002, p. 3</footer>
    </blockquote>
    <p><q>Most young children come to school already knowing a great deal about mathematics.… For example, they bring conceptual understanding from their daily experiences with manipulating objects (e.g., fitting different sizes and shapes of a
        construction toy together), making comparisons (e.g., ‘I’m taller than you’), making observations (e.g., ‘This bag is really heavy’), and asking questions (e.g., ‘Who is taller?’ ‘Who has more cookies?’ ‘How big is it?)</q> (Ontario Ministry
      of Education, 2010, p. 20). These concepts build the foundation for fractional thinking.</p>
    <p>Ideally, as students build on their sense of number throughout their elementary schooling, they are given opportunities to make many connections among whole numbers, fractions, decimals and percentages, which support them in deepening their
      understanding of proportionality and ratio. Further, in secondary school, students use this as a foundation for understanding mathematical relationships in algebra and learning related to linear relationships, trigonometry and radian measure.</p>
    <p>The College Student Achievement Project, an extensive study of student achievement in first-year college mathematics courses, identified an understanding of fractions as one of the most critical skills needed for college mathematics in both
      business and technology courses and as one of the main areas in which many students lacked that necessary understanding (Orpwood, Schollen, Leek, Marinelli-Henriques & Assiri, 2012). </p>
    <p>The National Mathematics Panel Report suggests that “difficulty with learning fractions is pervasive and is an obstacle to further progress in mathematics and other domains dependent upon mathematics, including algebra. It has also been
      linked to difficulties in adulthood, such as failure to understand medication regimens” (as cited in Petit, Laird & Marsden, 2010, p. xi). A solid understanding of the various meanings that fractions can have and a robust ability to reason
      with and operate on quantities with fractions will support students in their mathematics education and in daily living (e.g., cooking, carpentry, sewing).

    <h3>What Is a Fraction?</h3>
    <p>A fraction most simply represents a <strong>number</strong>, as shown on the number line below:</p>
    <img src="/images/attention/fracAtt2.png" alt="" class="img-responsive margin-auto" />
    <p>Yet within this very simple description lie some highly complex mathematical constructs that will be explored in this document. These constructs – part-whole relationships, part-part relationships, quotient and operator – are not mutually
      exclusive; they are different ways to represent and think about fractions.
    </p>
    <div class="purple-box">
      <p>Let’s take a closer look at the following fraction constructs:</p>

      <h4>First things First</h4>
      <p>Before we begin, here are a few questions and answers that you may find helpful.</p>
      <h4><em>What are a numerator and a denominator?</em></h4>
      <p>A numerator is the digit above the line in a fraction. A denominator is the digit below the line in a fraction. For example, in 34, the numerator is 3 and the denominator is 4.</p>
      <h4><em>What is an area model?</em></h4>
      <p>In an area model, one shape represents the whole. The whole is divided into fractional regions. Although the fractional regions are equal in area, they are not necessarily congruent (the same size and shape).</p>
      <h4><em>What is a set model?</em></h4>
      <p>In a set model, a collection of items represents the whole amount. Subsets of the whole make up the fractional parts. A variety of materials can serve as set models.</p>
      <h4><em>What is a volume model?</em></h4>
      <p>In a volume model, a three-dimensional figure represents the whole. The whole is divided into fractional regions that are occupied by space within the figure.</p>
    </div>
    <!--end well-->
    <h4>Part-Whole relationships</h4>
    <p>Learners are most familiar with the <strong>part-whole</strong> construct of fractions in which the denominator indicates the fractional unit being used, and the numerator indicates the number of fractional units being counted.</p>

            <p>When identifying a fraction of a set, any attribute can be considered. The items in the set can be of different sizes when another attribute, such as colour, is being considered, as in the example of the fruit. The whole is identified
              as the set of fruit.</p>
            <div class="purple-box">
              <p>What is an attribute?</p>
              <p><q>An attribute is a quantitative or qualitative characteristic of a shape or an object. Examples include colour, size, or shape</q>

    <p><strong><i>Number Line Model Representing Part-Whole Relationships</i></strong></p>
    <p>A fraction on a number line, as shown below, is another example of a part-whole relationship.
      In this case, the whole is 1.

          <h5>Let’s Recap Part-Whole Relationships</h5>
          <p>In part-whole relationships, the digit in the denominator indicates the fractional unit, or the number of equi-partitions, that the whole has been divided into. The digit in the numerator indicates the number of equi-partitions being
            counted. For example,</p>
          <img src="/images/attention/fracAtt8.png" alt="" class="img-responsive margin-auto" />

            <h4>Partition</h4>
            <p>To partition an area model means to divide it into non-overlapping regions. For fractional units of the whole, the emphasis is on partitioning into equal-size regions or <em>equi-partitioning</em>.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h4>Part-Part relationships</h4>
    <p>A fraction can also be used to represent a <strong>part-part relationship</strong>. Because of “the preoccupation with the understanding of fractions as parts of a whole, along with an overemphasis on proper fractions” (Bruce, Chang, Flynn &
      Yearley, 2013, p. 29), North American classrooms have traditionally provided limited practice in thinking about the part-part relationship.</p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>In the example of the set of fruit, we have a number of ways to describe the comparison of one part of the set to another part of the set. If we want to compare non-oranges to oranges in the set, we might say, “for every 7 pieces of fruit
          that are not oranges, there are 2 oranges” or “the ratio of non-oranges to oranges is 7 to 2 (7:2).”</p>
      </div>

    <p>If we used fractional notation, it would be <abbr title="Seven Halfs" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>7</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>2</sub></span></abbr> (read as seven-halves) as many pieces are not oranges as are oranges.</p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <div class="purple-box">
          <p>Adding the numerator and the denominator together determines the fractional unit being used to partition, or divide, the set, which in this case would be ninths.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-md-8 relative farr"><img src="/images/attention/fracAtt10.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" />
        <div class="num"> the numerator indicates a count of non-oranges.</div>
        <div class="den"> the denominator indicates a count of oranges.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Young learners who are accustomed to sorting sets of objects may initially describe sets by using part-part fractions. Older students investigate ratios, rates and proportions and then apply this understanding in the study of slope (rates of
      change), trigonometry and linear equations.</p>

    <div class="dotted-box">
      <h4>Let’s Recap Part-Part Relationships</h4>
      <p>In <strong>part-part relationships</strong>, the digit in the denominator indicates the number of items that are in one part of the set, and the digit in the numerator indicates the number of items that are in the other part of the set. The
        fractional unit, or number of equi-partitions of the whole, is determined by adding the digits in the numerator and denominator together. For example, </p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>The number of fruit in this set that are pears is <abbr title="Three Sixths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>3</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>6</sub></span></abbr> the number of fruit that are not pears.</p>

          <p>The total number of equi-partitions in the whole container is 7.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h4>Fraction as Quotient</h4>
    <p>The <strong>quotient</strong> construct of fractions relates to the notion of dividing the numerator by the denominator. In primary grades, students are initially exposed to fractions and the quotient construct through equal-share contexts.
      For example, if four students are sharing six items equally, they will need to partition the items evenly. This allotment could be accomplished in a number of ways. For example, equally sharing six brownies among four people might be
      accomplished by</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><span class="color-gr">❖</span> partitioning each brownie into fourths and then distributing the fourths</p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-8"><img src="/images/attention/fracAttBonus1.png" alt="brownie parts" class="img-responsive margin-auto" /></div>
          <div class="col-md-4 color-lil">Each person would get 6 one-fourths of a brownie.</div>
        </div>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span class="color-gr">❖</span> giving each person one full brownie and then equally sharing the remaining two brownies among the four people</p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-8"><img src="/images/attention/fracAttBonus2.png" alt="brownie parts" class="img-responsive margin-auto" /></div>
          <div class="col-md-4 color-lil">Each person would get one whole brownie, and then each person would also get one-half of the remaining two brownies.</div>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span class="color-gr">❖</span> partitioning the six brownies into four equal-size portions</p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-8"><img src="/images/attention/fracAttBonus3.png" alt="brownie parts" class="img-responsive margin-auto" /></div>
          <div class="col-md-4 color-lil">Each person would get one and one-half brownies.</div>
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This last method connects to the representation of <abbr title="Six Fourths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>6</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>4</sub></span></abbr> on the number line. Six is partitioned into four equal parts, and the
      magnitude or length of one part is considered.</p>
    <div class="center"><img src="/images/attention/fracAtt14.png" alt="fruits" class="img-responsive margin-auto" /></div>
    <p>Sometimes, the context used to pose the question can influence the strategy students select. For example, suppose the brownie question was revised to the following:</p>
    <p>Equally share these six cups of water among four people.</p>
    <div class="center"><img src="/images/attention/fracAttBonus4.png" alt="brownie parts" class="img-responsive margin-auto" /></div>
    <p>Students may tend to think of giving a full cup to each person and then sharing the remaining two cups equally by halves, rather than partitioning each cup of water into fourths.
    </p>
    <p>Later, students learn that dividing the numerator by the denominator results in the decimal equivalent for a fraction. From the example above, students can explore why <abbr title="Six Fourths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>6</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>4</sub></span></abbr>
      = 1.5.
    </p>
    <div class="dotted-box">
      <h4>Let’s Recap Fractions as Quotients</h4>
      <p>When considering a <strong>fraction as a quotient</strong>, the context of the question suggests equal sharing, or dividing the digit in the numerator by the digit in the denominator. The result is the decimal equivalent for the fraction.
        For example,</p>
      <div class="center"><abbr title="Six Fourths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>6</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>4</sub></span></abbr> = 6 ÷ 4 or 6 partitioned into 4 equal parts</div>
      <div class="center"><img src="/images/attention/fracAtt14.png" alt="fruits" class="img-responsive margin-auto" /></div>
      <div class="center">Each part is equal to 1<abbr title="One Half" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>2</sub></span></abbr> or 1.5.</div>
    </div>
    <h4>Fraction as operator</h4>
    <p>A fraction as an <strong>operator</strong> refers to the use of a fraction to enlarge or shrink a quantity by a factor. Students see this early in their learning when they consider taking one-third of a whole object, such as one-third of a
      granola bar. If students were exploring what one-third of a set of six marbles was, they would discover that one-third of six equals two. As students work with large numbers they may see the connection to multiplication and will use that
      knowledge to determine, for example, one-third of a school population (e.g., calculating <abbr title="One Third" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>3</sub></span></abbr> of 850 students can be thought of
      as <abbr title="One Third" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>3</sub></span></abbr> x 850 students).</p>
    <div class="dotted-box">
      <h5>Let’s Recap Fractions as Operators</h5>
      <p>When considering a fraction as an operator, the fraction reduces or increases a quantity. For example,</p>

    <p><strong><em>In the chart, note that each numerator and denominator could also be negative.</em></strong></p>
    <p>In the Ontario mathematics curriculum for Grades 1 to 8, simple fractions are the focus of learning about fractions, while secondary students work with complex fractions, as well as with both simple (e.g., <abbr title="x fifths" class="abbr-frac"><span
          class="frac"><sup>x</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>5</sub></span></abbr>) and complex (e.g., <abbr title="X fifths over X fifteenths" class="abbr-frac-double-comp"><span class="frac"><sup><span class="frac"><sup>x</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>5</sub></span></sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub><span
              class="frac"><sup>x</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>15</sub></span></sub></span></abbr>) algebraic fractions. Presenting students with improper or mixed fractions in conjunction with proper and unit fractions allows them to develop a
      sense of fraction as a number. This presentation also helps to avoid over-reliance on a limited understanding of fractions, which may evolve from learning only about proper fractions. An example of this occurs when students consider a fraction
      to mean “out of,” such as <abbr title="Seven ninths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>7</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>9</sub></span></abbr> means “7 out of 9.” This idea could lead to students struggling with the meaning of <abbr
        title="Nine Sevenths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>9</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>7</sub></span></abbr> , as it doesn’t make sense to have “9 out of 7.”</p>
    <p>As the samples in the chart demonstrate, simple fractions include fractional units other than halves, thirds, fourths, fifths and eighths. Fraction number sense is enhanced by opportunities to explore fractional concepts through a range of
      fractions, including those with “less friendly” denominators.</p>
    <p>The types of fractions in the chart can be used in each of the constructs (i.e., part-whole, part-part, quotient and operator). The representations of continuous models (i.e., area, number line, volume) and discrete models (i.e., set) should
      be used for each construct. </p>
    <p>When students are developing their understanding of fractions, they may record a relationship by including a decimal in the numerator, such as <abbr title="Two and Half Sixths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>2.5</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>6</sub></span></abbr>.
      Although the reasoning may be mathematically correct, this is an awkward notation. Students should be supported in making sense of how this notation is equivalent to others generated by their classmates, such as <abbr title="Five Twelfths"
        class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>5</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>12</sub></span></abbr> or <abbr title="Ten Twenty-fourths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>10</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>24</sub></span></abbr>.</p>

    </div>
    <p>In a part-whole fraction, the digit in the denominator indicates the fractional unit, or the number of equi-partitions of the whole being considered.</p>
    <p>In a continuous model, such as a number line or shape, there is equal length or area in each partition.</p>

    <p>Students develop flexibility in their representations of unit fractions, which include the use of physical models, pictures and numbers. It is important that they are given opportunities to create unit fractions through equi-partitioning and
      through re-creating the whole by iterating, or repeating, a unit fraction.</p>

          number sense. Students improve their understanding of relative magnitude by considering the impact on the size of the equi-partition as the denominator is changed. When students use models, they can develop and test conjectures about these
          relationships, such as <q>As I cut the area into more regions, each region is smaller. I think that the larger the digit in the denominator, the smaller the region will be. So I think that <abbr title="One Tenth" class="abbr-frac"><span

      <h4 class="key-green">The Whole</h4>
    </div>
    <p>In any fraction, there is an implied relationship between the whole, the number of parts and the portion being considered. For example, when a fraction is presented symbolically without a context or a model, it is assumed to be a part-whole
      fraction. Being clear about the relationship being represented by a fraction by including a precise description using words or using a visual model helps in differentiating among the different uses of fractions.</p>
    <p>It is helpful for students to recognize the various possibilities and to be flexible in the interpretation of fractions. It is therefore important to be precise with language based on the construct of the fraction (e.g., part-whole,
      part-part, quotient and operator). For example, when considering a rectangular model in which the part-whole relationship of <abbr title="Three Halfs" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>3</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>2</sub></span></abbr>
      refers to the fraction of area that is shaded (see example below), the whole is the area of the rectangle.</p>

    <p>The whole rectangle has been partitioned into fractional units of halves, and three of these regions have been shaded. The digit in the denominator provides information about how the whole has been divided, in this case into halves. The digit
      in the denominator is not the whole; the whole is not 2.</p>
    <p>When considering <abbr title="Three Halfs" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>3</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>2</sub></span></abbr> as a quotient, the 3 (the numerator) is the whole and the 2 (the denominator) shows the number of

      <h4 class="key-orange">Equivalency</h4>
    </div>
    <p>When determining equivalent fractions, students are identifying different fractional units that can be used to describe a quantity (e.g., <abbr title="One Third" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>3</sub></span></abbr>
      = <abbr title="Five Fifteenths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>5</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>15</sub></span></abbr> = <abbr title="Seven Twenty-first" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>7</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>21</sub></span></abbr>
      ). Students need to have many opportunities to use their proportional and spatial reasoning skills to flexibly determine equivalent part-whole fractions by using models rather than being exposed to an algorithm, such as “‘doubling the
      numerator and denominator.” Moss and Case (1999) are clear in their finding that “a greater emphasis on the meanings or semantics of rational numbers [rather] than [on] procedures for manipulating them…, [as well as on] the proportional nature
      of rational numbers” (p. 139) are key components of programs that produce a deeper understanding.</p>
    <span class="semi-bold">Using a Number Line Model to Represent Equivalent Fractions</span>
    <p>It is possible to generate an infinite number of equivalent fractions.</p>
    <p>Consider the fraction <abbr title="Twelve Eighths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>12</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>8</sub></span></abbr>, modelled on a number line.</p>
    <div class="center">
      <img src="/images/attention/fracAtt31.png" alt="line" class="img-responsive" />
    </div>
    <p>There are two main strategies for generating equivalent fractions: merging partitions together and splitting partitions further. Merging combines partitions to create fewer, larger partitions.</p>
    <p>Merging Partitions</p>
    <div class="center">
      <img src="/images/attention/fracAtt32.png" alt="line" class="img-responsive" />
    </div>
    <p>In this example, the larger partitions are created by merging 4 one-eighth units into one unit of one-half. This merging creates 3 one-half units. Three-halves are equivalent to twelve-eighths.</p>
    <p>In this case, it would also be correct to merge 2 one-eighth units into one unit of one-fourth. This merging would generate the equivalent fraction of six-fourths.</p>
    <p>Using this same example, we can use splitting to generate an equivalent fraction. There are no limits to the number of splits we can make to the existing partitioning, although a large number of splits, such as 24, is difficult to represent
      visually. Let’s split each one-eighth partition into thirds.</p>
    <p>Splitting Partitions</p>
    <div class="center">
      <img src="/images/attention/fracAtt33.png" alt="line" class="img-responsive" />
    </div>
    <p>In this example, there are 36 one-twenty-fourth units in 12 one-eighth units.</p>
    <span class="semi-bold">Using a Set Model to Represent Equivalent Fractions</span>
    <p>Splitting and merging can also be used to determine equivalent fractions with set models. Students find this easier when the set is constructed of items that can be split, such as apples or pieces of paper, as opposed to marbles, desks or
      people.</p>

    <span class="semi-bold">The Whole Matters: Consider This</span>
    <p>When determining equivalent part-whole fractions or comparing part-whole fractions by using models, it is important that the whole remains unchanged. The careful selection of models increases the likelihood that the whole will be preserved
      when splitting. Number lines and rectangles are excellent models for determining equivalent fractions. It is important that students also have experience with determining equivalent fractions by using set models, as this will aid them in
      understanding the impact of changing the whole.</p>
    <p>Consider this example where the whole has been changed: When determining an equivalent fraction for the paper set on page 15 some students may add more pieces, creating accurate models of the fractions <abbr title="Four Sixths" class="abbr-frac"><span
          class="frac"><sup>4</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>6</sub></span></abbr> (Fig. 1) and <abbr title="Eight Twelfths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>8</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>12</sub></span></abbr> (Fig. 2). However, although
      it is true that <abbr title="Four Sixths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>4</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>6</sub></span></abbr> = <abbr title="Eigth Twelfths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>8</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>12</sub></span></abbr>
      numerically, Figure 2 shows an equivalent ratio rather than an equivalent fraction to the representation in Figure 1, since the whole has been changed from 6 pieces of paper to 12.</p>

      <li>
        <span class="color-gr">❖</span> If students are prematurely or solely exposed to symbolic procedures for determining equivalent fractions, they are prevented from connecting this procedure to the visual models. Being able to make such links
        will allow them to relate equivalent fractions to proportional reasoning and to whole numbers and decimals, and support them in making sense of algebraic fractions, such as <abbr title="a over 2b" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>a</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>2b</sub></span></abbr>,
        in later grades.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="color-gr">❖</span> It is important to use precise language when supporting fractions learning. Consider <abbr title="Four Sixths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>4</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>6</sub></span></abbr>,
        for example. Some might say that the equivalent fraction of <abbr title="Twelve Eighteenths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>12</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>18</sub></span></abbr> is obtained by multiplying the numerator and
        denominator by 3. Some students may find this confusing as they understand that multiplying by 3 is the same as tripling a quantity. They therefore may see the new fraction as representing three times as much as the original fraction rather
        than an equivalent amount. Mathematically, the equivalent fraction is more correctly an example of splitting each sixth further into thirds. Symbolically, the fraction <abbr title="Four Sixths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>4</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>6</sub></span></abbr>
        is multiplied by <abbr title="Three Thirds" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>3</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>3</sub></span></abbr> (which is equivalent to 1), generating an equivalent fraction without changing the quantity. Although
        this distinction may seem trivial, it is essential for secondary students when they are working with algebraic expressions, such as <abbr title="a over 2b" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>a</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>2b</sub></span></abbr>
        + <abbr title="two over c" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>2</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>c</sub></span></abbr>, and are trying to generate equivalent fractions with a denominator of 2bc. They need to multiply the first term by
        <abbr title="c over c" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>c</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>c</sub></span></abbr> while recognizing that this is not changing the value of the original fraction.

      <li>
        <p><span class="color-gr">❖</span> Some students become over-reliant on the process of “doubling both the numerator and the denominator.” This strategy may not be an effective way to compare <abbr title="Seven Ninths" class="abbr-frac"><span

        <p>The sets of equivalent fractions above, while mathematically correct, are not at all helpful in determining equivalent fractions for comparison. Juxtapose this with a student who understands that each of the ninths can be split further

        <p>The student can then draw or visualize that the appropriate equivalent fractions are <abbr title="thirty-five Forty-fifths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>35</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>45</sub></span></abbr> and <abbr title="Twenty-seven Forty-fifths"

          > <abbr title="Three Fifths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>3</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>5</sub></span></abbr> since 35 forty-fifth units is more than 27 forty-fifth units. This conclusion allows the student to understand
          that the common denominator represents the common fractional unit, rather than the value generated by “multiplying the denominators,” which does not reflect the mathematics underlying the procedure.</p>

            > <abbr title="Three Sevenths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>3</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>7</sub></span></abbr> .” This thinking demonstrates an understanding of the multiplicative relationship between the numerator and

    <span class="semi-bold">Using Common Numerators</span>
    <p>Another strategy students may use to compare fractions is common numerators. They might initially reason when comparing <abbr title="Seven Elevenths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>7</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>11</sub></span></abbr>
      and <abbr title="Seven Thirteenths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>7</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>13</sub></span></abbr> that since the digits in the numerators are the same, the fractions are equal. However, on further
      investigation, students will realize that elevenths are larger than thirteenths, so 7 elevenths is larger.</p>
    <span class="semi-bold">Using Equivalent Fractions</span>
    <p>Students might also use their understanding of equivalent fractions to generate common numerators for comparison. For example, when comparing <abbr title="Three Elvenths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>3</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>11</sub></span></abbr>
      and <abbr title="Six Ninteenths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>6</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>19</sub></span></abbr> , students may identify <abbr title="Six Twenty-seconds" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>6</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>22</sub></span></abbr>
      as equal to <abbr title="Three Elevenths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>3</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>11</sub></span></abbr>. They can use the strategy of common numerators to determine that <abbr title="Three Elevenths" class="abbr-frac"><span
          class="frac"><sup>3</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>11</sub></span></abbr>
      < <abbr title="Six Ninteenths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>6</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>19</sub></span></abbr>. Notice that in this example, determining an equivalent fraction for one fraction involves much simpler
        calculations (which might be performed mentally) than determining a common denominator.

    <span class="semi-bold">Using Unit Fractions</span>
    <p>When students are ordering fractions like <abbr title="Ten Elevenths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>10</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>11</sub></span></abbr> and <abbr title="Twelve Thirteenths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>12</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>13</sub></span></abbr>,
      they can use the notion that the gap between the numerator and denominator is 1 fractional unit in both. They might further reason that since thirteenths are smaller than elevenths, there is less missing from the whole partitioned into
      thirteenths, so <abbr title="Twelve Thirteenths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>12</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>13</sub></span></abbr> is closer to 1 and therefore is greater than <abbr title="Ten Elevenths" class="abbr-frac"><span

      <h4 class="key-red">Operations</h4>
    </div>
    <p><q>Without the requisite conceptual understanding such as the importance of equivalence, estimation, unit fractions, and part-whole relationships, students struggle to complete calculations with fractions</q> (Bruce, Chang, Flynn & Yearley,
      2013, p. 17). When students explore fraction concepts in a variety of meaningful ways, they develop an implicit understanding of the operations of addition, subtraction, division and multiplication. These experiences begin in primary grades,
      as discussed previously in this document, and continue through to the intermediate grades, where students are typically introduced to the formal algorithms for these operations. In secondary mathematics, these foundational concepts are
      extended to algebraic expressions and to applications of fractions in contexts such as trigonometric ratios, radian measure (e.g., <abbr title="Two Thirds" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>2</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>3</sub></span></abbr>
      π) and probability.</p>
    <p>Let’s examine the implicit learning before discussing formal algorithms. When students decompose a part-whole fraction into unit fractions, they often use an addition statement to communicate their thinking. For example, a student may see
      that <abbr title="Five Elevenths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>5</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>11</sub></span></abbr> can be:</p>
    <ul>

    </ul>
    <p>These connections allow students to develop an understanding of the role of the numerator (count) and denominator (fractional unit) and see that for both addition and multiplication, the unit remains unchanged. The Ontario mathematics
      curriculum identifies several opportunities for these types of connections to be introduced and developed from primary grades through to senior grades (Ontario Ministry of Education, 2005a, 2005b). These opportunities will form a solid basis
      on which algorithms can be developed and learned.</p>
    <p>Similarly, decomposing a part-whole fraction can result in subtraction and division statements.</p>
    <p>Consider <abbr title="Six Fourths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>6</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>4</sub></span></abbr>. Students may say that <abbr title="Six Fourths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>6</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>4</sub></span></abbr>
      – <abbr title="Four Fourths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>4</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>4</sub></span></abbr> = <abbr title="Two Fourths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>2</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>4</sub></span></abbr>.</p>
    <p>They may also represent this by using a picture (see below) and identify that <abbr title="Six Fourths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>6</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>4</sub></span></abbr> – <abbr title="One Half" class="abbr-frac"><span

    <p>Young students reason with fractions as operators, or multiplication by a fraction, when solving problems of equal sharing, such as determining <abbr title="One Third" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>3</sub></span></abbr>
      of the volume of a pitcher or <abbr title="Three Fifths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>3</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>5</sub></span></abbr> of the area of a figure. Older students extend this knowledge by solving problems such as,
      “There was <abbr title="One Half" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>2</sub></span></abbr> a pan of lasagna left. My dad ate <abbr title="Two Thirds" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>2</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>3</sub></span></abbr>
      of the remaining lasagna, and my sister ate the rest. What fraction of the whole pan did my sister eat?” Think about what you are seeing in your head as you read that problem. How might you solve the problem by using visualization rather than
      an algorithm?</p>
    <div class="row center">

        class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>2</sub></span></abbr> , and you could calculate the answer of <abbr title="One Sixth" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>6</sub></span></abbr>.
      Some may see this equation as a much more complicated solution than that obtained by an illustration.</p>

    <h3 class="color-lil">How Can We Promote Fractions Thinking?</h3>
    <p>Research results clearly show that improving students’ understanding of fractions occurs through more precise instruction rather than through significant increases in the time spent learning about fractions (Watanabe, 2012). Teachers are
      encouraged to be thoughtful and intentional in selection of resources and learning opportunities to maximize learning. </p>
    <!--start well-->
    <div class="purple-box">
      <p>The following strategies apply not only when students are initially exposed to fractions but also when new concepts are being introduced, such as operations with fractions, and when fractions are being used in new contexts, such as
        trigonometry and functions.</p>
      <p>These sample strategies are organized under the following key concepts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><span class="color-gr">❖</span> unit fractions</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span class="color-gr">❖</span> representations</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span class="color-gr">❖</span> equivalence and comparing</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span class="color-gr">❖</span> operations</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--end well-->
    <h4>Unit Fractions</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><span class="color-gr">❖</span> Focus on unit fractions to develop fractional number sense. Students should</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>&mdash; count by unit fractions (starting at 0 and extending beyond 1) to develop a sense of a fraction as a number, the role of the numerator and denominator, and the relationship between the numerator and denominator.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>&mdash; compose and decompose fractions into unit fractions.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>&mdash; develop an understanding of benchmarks. Very young students often have an implicit understanding of common benchmarks, such as one-half, one whole, one and one-half. As students become familiar with an increasing range of
              fractions, they should be developing a correspondingly broad set of benchmarks for reference, which will include equivalent fractions for the more common benchmarks.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span class="color-gr">❖</span> Have students equi-partition figures and identify fractions of area and set models from the outset rather than providing pre-partitioned figures.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span class="color-gr">❖</span> Introduce mixed and proper fractions simultaneously. Young students see both in equal-share contexts, and continued exposure to both supports the development of correct generalizations.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span class="color-gr">❖</span> Use precise language. Unless specifically referring to a part-part relationship (such as “5 to 4”), all fractions should be read as a number. For example, <abbr title="Five Fourths" class="abbr-frac"><span
              class="frac"><sup>5</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>4</sub></span></abbr> is five-fourths not</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>&mdash; five over four, which confuses students by focusing on the physical arrangement of the digits or</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>&mdash; five out of four, which doesn’t support understanding of a fraction as a single number</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>&mdash; five quarters, which obscures the fractional unit and requires students to connect to the context of money, where they must then realize that a quarter is one-fourth of a dollar and not attend to the fact that a quarter is 25
              cents. Students can then apply this understanding of one-fourth to the contextual usage of quarter, such as “a quarter of a dollar,” “a quarter of an hour” and “the first quarter of a basketball game” – in each case, the whole is
              representing a different quantity (one dollar, one hour, one 48-minute game).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Secondary students should also understand that fractions represent a number when presented in such contexts as algebraic expressions and radian measure. <abbr title="Five Fourths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>5</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>4</sub></span></abbr>x
              may appear as <abbr title="Five X's Fourths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>5x</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>4</sub></span></abbr> but should be read as five x fourths or five-fourths x rather than as “5x over 4.” Similarly,
              <abbr title="Five Fourths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>5</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>4</sub></span></abbr>π should be read as five-fourths π rather than as “five π by four.”</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Representations</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><span class="color-gr">❖</span> Introduce notation alongside pictorial representations, as is done with whole numbers.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span class="color-gr">❖</span> Use representations that have longevity across grades and content, such as number lines, rectangles, and volume. Commercial manipulatives, such as fraction bars and number rods are helpful.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span class="color-gr">❖</span> Introduce a new concept with a familiar representation, and introduce a new representation for a concept the students are already familiar with. For example, use a number line with primary students when
          first introducing unit fractions as they have experience with whole numbers on the line. Later,
          represent these same unit fractions when introducing a new model, such as a rectangle.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span class="color-gr">❖</span> Use both continuous representations (such as area, volume, and a number line) and discrete representations (i.e., sets) for representing both part-whole and part-part relationships.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span class="color-gr">❖</span> Avoid introducing circles in primary and junior grades for representing fractions. This representation requires students to understand the area of a circle, which is an intermediate curriculum expectation.
          Also, a circle is difficult to equi-partition for fractions other than <abbr title="One Half" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>2</sub></span></abbr>, <abbr title="One Fourth" class="abbr-frac"><span
              class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>4</sub></span></abbr>, <abbr title="One Eighth" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>8</sub></span></abbr> and perhaps <abbr title="One Third" class="abbr-frac"><span
              class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>3</sub></span></abbr> (since students frequently see this fraction represented by using a circle).</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Equivalence and Comparing</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><span class="color-gr">❖</span> Engage students in tasks that require them to determine equivalent fractions through splitting and merging by using models before introducing a symbolic procedure.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span class="color-gr">❖</span> Challenge students’ understanding of fraction equivalence by changing the wholes so that students learn that they must consider the whole, the numerator and the denominator when comparing fractions.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span class="color-gr">❖</span> Support students in connecting to other number systems for equivalence, such as whole numbers, and decimals (<abbr title="Twelve Halfs" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>12</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>2</sub></span></abbr>
          = 6 ; <abbr title="Twelve Fifths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>12</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>5</sub></span></abbr> = 2.4).</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Operations</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><span class="color-gr">❖</span> Build on students’ intuitive understanding of the operations on whole numbers as they have been developed throughout the primary and junior grades. Students learn early that addition can occur only between
          quantities with like units; for example, one dollar and one cent do not equal two since the units are different.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span class="color-gr">❖</span> Ensure that essential prior understanding is in place (see Math Teaching for Learning: Building to Addition and Subtraction of Fractions at www.edugains.ca), rather than introducing algorithms prematurely.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="color-lil">Fractions across Strands and Grades</h3>
    <p>In several school boards, teachers involved in collaborative action research about learning and teaching fractions have identified the positive impact on student understanding when fractions are explored in a punctuated, or chunked, fashion
      throughout the school year rather than within a discrete unit. (For more discussion on this, see Flynn, McPherson and Yearley’s Results of Collaborative Action Research on Fractions, 2011–2012 in the Professional Learning about Fractions
      digital paper available at www.edugains.ca.) Punctuated instruction allows teachers to be responsive to student thinking when planning subsequent activities and allows students to connect their fractions knowledge to the learning of other
      mathematical concepts. In this way, teachers narrow the focus of learning to key fractions concepts, such as unit fractions, and slow down the learning to allow students to spend the necessary time on one task or on multiple connected tasks.</p>
    <p>Although the curriculum is specific about which meanings students are responsible for understanding at each grade level, teachers who have a deep understanding of all the meanings will not only be better able will also be better equipped to
      identify student thinking that is mathematically correct but unexpected in the specific learning context. This understanding will allow teachers to support students in connecting their knowledge to the desired learning outcomes.</p>
