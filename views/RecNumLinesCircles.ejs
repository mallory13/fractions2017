    <h4 style="color:black;">Why We Should Care About Students’ Over Reliance on Circle Representations in Fractions</h4>
    <p>Circles are difficult for students to partition accurately, especially with large or odd numbers of partitions. As a result, students may focus more on the number of partitions and less on their equivalency. Research indicates that students
      become overly reliant on circles, continuing to use them in contexts where they are no longer helpful, such as distance contexts involving tenths of a kilometer. Furthermore, students are reluctant to replace the use of circles as a ‘go to’
      representation with more powerful representations, such as number lines and rectangles, when these are introduced later.</p>
    <p>Although circles are often introduced as an early representation within the context of pizza, generally their usefulness for students is limited to fourths, halves and eighths. Changing the partitioning of the whole is more difficult to do
      when using circle representations than number lines or rectangular area models. Suppose when asked to represent sixths, a student draws a circle and partitions it into fourths, then recognizes that the partitions should be sixths. The student
      may further partition the fourths to create twelfths and then merge twelfths into sixths. But more typically, the student will erase their work and begin again, or add two more partitions to the fourths to create six unequal regions.
      Alternatively, using a rectangular area model, sixths can be easily created from fourths by adding two more equal partitions resulting in a larger whole. A number line can be adapted by extending it in a similar way. Note that when <strong>comparing</strong>
      fractions, attention must be given to same sized wholes.</p>

      <h4 style="color:black;">Using Circles in Contexts</h4>
      <p>Sometimes young children encounter mathematical contexts requiring them to partition a circle, such as analogue clocks and circle graphs. Accurately equi-partitioning the area of a circle requires students to conceptually understand the
        area of a circle, something not introduced until intermediate grades. When students don’t understand the area of a circle, they may partition the circle like this:</p>

    <p>As an alternative, when teaching the telling of time on an analogue clock or creating circle graphs, consider thinking about the circumference as a wrapped number line. This allows students to unwrap the number line to create a linear
      representation that can be more easily equi-partitioned.</p>

    <p>The central angle of 360° can also be used as the referent for partitioning a circle, which would be useful to students studying spinner probability. The arrow of a spinner rotates around the central angle of 360° and the partitions of the
      spinner are based on equal partitions of this angle rather than the areas of the partitions. The following spinners demonstrate this difference.</p>
