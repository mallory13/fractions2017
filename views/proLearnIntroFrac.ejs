          <ul>
            <li>A fraction can be represented in a number of ways. The representation you select/use
              influences the meaning/interpretation of the fraction.</li>
            <li>One representation may have different meanings, depending on the assumptions the viewer makes. Careful wording can reduce the number of different assumptions.</li>
            <li>It is important to be specific with students about the context and meaning of the fractions you are using.</li>

          <p><strong>Individual -> Activity (15 min)</strong></p>
          <p>Using a variety of manipulatives, participants identify a fraction of their choosing and
            then represent it in as many ways as possible. A picture of each different model will be
            recorded on a separate sticky note.</p>

          <p><strong>Whole Group -> Sort Activity (5 min)</strong></p>
          <p>Individuals post their sticky notes on chart paper under each of the following different
            meanings of fractions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Linear Measure
              <ul>
                <li>Position (point) on a number line</li>
                <li>Segment of a number line</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Part - whole: continuous
              <ul>
                <li>area (2-D) Include discussion of strengths of rectangular representations over circular representations</li>
                <li>volume (3-D)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Part - whole: discrete sets with either identical or non-identical shape/size items</li>
            <li>Part - Part ratio representation which shows numerator : denominator</li>
            <li>Quotient</li>
            <li>Operator</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Small Group -> Discussion (15 min)</strong></p>
          <p>Each group takes a sheet and organizes it, annotating to add meaning. If any sheet has
            no sticky notes on it, the group creates as many different types of examples as they can
            and organizes these examples. The group may identify some sticky notes that they
            believe would be better suited to a different meaning/sheet. Inform them that they will
            be sharing out at the end of the activity.</p>

              <p>Participants review the Gap Closing materials connected to Fractions with a view to
                discussing connections to earlier conversations. Demonstrate the Fractions CLIPS online
                (and explain the ePractice connections to Gap Closing). Engage them in a
                discussion (think/pair/share) about how they may integrate these into their program.
                Record these on chart paper.</p>
