            <h1>Student Learning</h1>

            <h3>Research Story</h3>
            <p>Students consistently demonstrated a broad range of conceptions of fractions and were persistent in using this prior knowledge. Although many students held misconceptions, they simultaneously held correct understandings about number in general and fractions in particular. When teachers had a clear understanding of student understanding of fractions, their instructional decisions were more precise.</p>
            <p>Teams explored appropriate use of a variety of manipulatives and representations. Students deepened their understanding, using manipulatives and representations as a site for problem solving to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>further deepen and refine their thinking</li>
                <li>confirm/refute the validity of other representations</li>
                <li>privilege representations other than numeric/symbolic</li>
                <li>connect different interpretations of fractions (<abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr>, part-whole as continuous, part-whole as discrete, part-part, operator, quotient, linear measure), and</li>
                <li>communicate their thinking</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Student engagement with fractions ideas and learning</h3>
            <p>The teams took advantage of the collective knowledge about fractions in the classroom to enhance individual understandings. Developing a math talk learning community allowed students to reveal their thinking. When students were allowed to grapple with their misconceptions through dialogue with peers, they often developed a more accurate and robust understanding of fractions concepts. Open tasks allowed students to apply their knowledge and build on it throughout the lesson.</p>
            <p>Students in all grades demonstrated success using number lines to represent, compare and order fractions. The number line emphasized fraction as a number and also allowed students to make connections to decimals and percents. Close examination of student work in the process revealed a high reliance on area models, particularly circles, in spite of difficulty with partitioning circles into equal parts. This was new learning for educators, who had rarely used number lines to explore fractions with students previously. In general, students favoured one of area or set models and had difficulty moving flexibly between the two.</p>

            <h3>Student engagement with rich tasks</h3>
            <p>As student needs became more apparent, teachers made precise and purposeful task selections. Sources for these tasks included professional journals and research articles, textbooks, resource books, as well as lessons co-planned by the team.</p>
            <p>Three main questions emerged related to the teaching and learning of fractions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Which representations support students in acquiring a deep understanding of fractions?</li>
                <li>When is accuracy in representations important?</li>
                <li>When should misconceptions be permitted to stand?</li>
            </ol>
    
            <ol>
                <li> Which representations support students in acquiring a deep understanding of fractions?
                    <ul>
                        <li>Students relied heavily on hand-constructed circle models to represent their thinking. This representation proved limiting when trying to compare fractions such as <abbr title="two fifths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>2</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>5</sub></span></abbr> and <abbr title="four tenths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>4</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>10</sub></span></abbr>, for the simple fact that it is spatially difficult to partition a circle into tenths and fifths. Some representations also reinforce the common student misconception that a fraction represents two numbers (the two and the five in two fifths, for example) and not one singular quantity or number as is the case. This misconception is reinforced, for example, when students count the sections of a circle without understanding that the circle represents the whole. The use of linear models and rectangular models avoided some of these challenges and supported an increased understanding of fraction concepts.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li> When is accuracy in representations important?
                    <ul>
                        <li>When hand-drawing a representation, it was important for students to understand how much accuracy is required. Some students found it difficult to articulate the situations that required less or more accuracy. For example, when using a hand-drawn representation to compare <abbr title="two fifths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>2</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>5</sub></span></abbr> and <abbr title="eight ninths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>8</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>9</sub></span></abbr>, a high degree of accuracy may not be necessary for students who easily see that <abbr title="two fifths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>2</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>5</sub></span></abbr> is closer to 0 and <abbr title="eight ninths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>8</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>9</sub></span></abbr> is closer to 1, so will conclude that <abbr title="two fifths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>2</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>5</sub></span></abbr> is less than <abbr title="eight ninths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>8</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>9</sub></span></abbr>. However, when comparing <abbr title="two fifths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>2</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>5</sub></span></abbr> and <abbr title="one third" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>3</sub></span></abbr>, more precise representations may be required to ensure that an accurate comparison is made.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li> When should misconceptions be permitted to stand?
                    <ul>
                        <li>In this study, teams found that letting student misconceptions stand, even overnight, did not solidify the misconception but rather gave the student time to think it through. Careful selection of rich tasks challenged students to revisit their fragile understandings and through discussion/exploration both in class and beyond class time, cemented more precise and accurate conceptions of fractions.</li>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Student engagement with one another</h3>
            <p>In classrooms where the math-talk learning community was purposefully developed, students were able to communicate their reasoning clearly with classmates in small and whole group settings. Students used word walls, anchor charts, manipulatives and technologies, such as the document camera and interactive whiteboard, to increase the precision of their communication. Students were able to agree and disagree with reason to revise and refine their individual and collective understandings.</p>
                
            <h3>Student engagement with the teacher</h3>
            <p>Students developed and refined their understanding of fractions through dialogue with their teacher, particularly when the teacher probed to understand student thinking rather than focusing on the correctness of student responses. Teachers in the collaborative action research fractions project were learners with their colleagues and their students. This learning stance made students more acutely aware that their ideas were valued, and used to direct future learning opportunities. The fact that their teachers were engaged in research informed by their responses got students excited about sharing their learning, knowing that their ideas were being discussed with the research team.</p>

And could Courtney, and then maybe even, are there specific questions that we would have the kids ask the other students so that maybe Mackenzie and Macaleigh might think ‘Oh, I am having trouble explaining it to them. Maybe I don’t really know.</q>

                                        Teachers in the collaborative action research fractions study were learners with their colleagues and their students. This learning stance made students more acutely aware that their ideas were valued, and used to direct future learning opportunities. Students were excited about sharing their learning, knowing that their ideas were being discussed with the research team.

                                        Kerry: <q>I think the kids were more engaged because I sat down yesterday and I said I was coming to this today and we wanted to know what they know. So they just started throwing things out and started off with ‘well, we know one-half. We are really confident with one-half.’ Then they went and gave me all kinds of equivalent fractions but, you know, different orders of one-half. Then they went on to talk about the set model and the area model, didn’t spend too much time on that and then went right to the number line and said ‘Oh, we learned that number lines are really important and that it is easier to order and compare using them.’ And it, it was just, and they talked, they were engaged and I was kind of surprised that I had them engaged for that length of time. And scribbling, like I was scribbling things on the chart as they were speaking, and um, I think it was because they took part it in, it wasn’t just an ‘O.K., bang, bang, bang, today we are going to do this, and then bang, bang, bang’ and it just keeps moving, like turning the page. It was kind of getting into that book and talking about that story as opposed to just moving to the next chapter.</q>
