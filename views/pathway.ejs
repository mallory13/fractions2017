            <li>The most appropriate models for multiplication and division of fractions are number lines and rectangular area models (array models).</li>
            <li>Mixed, improper and proper fractions should be interspersed throughout fractions teaching and learning.</li>

            <ul><li>the multiple meanings of multiplication and division with whole numbers;</li>
              <li>unit fractions;</li>

    <p>Created by Dr. Cathy Bruce, Tara Flynn, and Shelley Yearley.</p>
    <p>Fractions Learning Pathways are inspired by Dr. Jere Confrey's work, based on international and Ontario classroom research, and informed by feedback from classroom teachers and student thinking.</p>

  <section id="infoParagraph">
    <p>The purpose of this interactive planning tool for teaching fractions is to provide educators with a research informed framework. It includes a range of field-tested tasks (grades 3-10) that have proven to be effective in Ontario schools. The collection of tasks follows a logical sequence that can be modified and/or adjusted to fit teacher and student needs. Video and photos are also included to bring the learning to life. This interactive planning tool also includes one page summaries of key fractions math ideas as well as anticipation guides that feature Ontario students’ thinking.</p>
