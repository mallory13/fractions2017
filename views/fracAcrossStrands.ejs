            <p>How does measuring length on a ruler in different units (i.e., mm, cm) compare with counting by different fractional
              units (e.g., halves, thirds, fifths) along a number line?</p>

            <p>Molly used a small container to fill one larger container exactly full of water. She needed to fill the small
              container exactly full five times to do this. Describe the relationship of the capacity of the smaller container
              to the larger container in two different ways.</p>

            <p>Create a model of 2 <abbr title="Four Tenths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>4</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>10</sub></span></abbr>. Use your model to identify pairs of fractions that combine to create 2 <abbr title="Four Tenths"
                class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>4</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>10</sub></span></abbr>. What patterns or connections do you see between the different pairs of fractions?</p>

            <h5>Data Management and Probability</h5>
            <p>Two number cubes each have the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 on their faces. How do the probabilities of rolling
              a sum of 4 and rolling a sum of 7 compare?</p>
            <p>Noah is playing a game and needs to select one of three spinners. One spinner is partitioned into fourths, one
              into fifths and one into sevenths. Each spinner has three green sections. He will win if he lands on a green
              section. Which spinner should he play with if he wants to win?</p>
