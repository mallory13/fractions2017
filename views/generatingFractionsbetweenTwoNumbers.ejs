      <h4>Description</h4>
      <p>This is a set of progressive prompts that will elicit the use of various strategies used to find fractions between two numbers. The prompts, when used in sequence, support students in choosing a strategy based upon the fractions being considered. Encourage students to build models/representations and create contexts to aid in visualization. This series of prompts can be used for a variety of grades and purposes. The time required will vary depending on the grade level and student readiness.</p>
      
      <h4>Mathematics</h4>
      <p>Density of fractions refers to the important mathematical idea that between any two fractions there are an infinite number of fractions. Understanding this mathematical fact is a crucial stage in the development of fraction sense. This is a novel concept for students, since it is not encountered in the whole number system (there are either zero or a finite number of whole numbers between any two whole numbers). Students are encouraged to develop a range of different strategies and to use them strategically, based on the situation. Research shows that it is beneficial to spread fraction learning throughout the year and embed it in other strands. Density is also a key concept in measurement.</p>

            <h2>Generating Fractions between Two Numbers (Fraction Density) (Comp C) Teacher Notes: Anticipating Student Responses</h2>
            <p>These prompts can be used flexibly depending on student readiness, including as assessment for learning, activating prior knowledge, learning tasks or assessment of learning. These prompts are sequenced to allow students to build models/representations and create contexts to support visualization of the meaning of the fractions. The prompts are in a progression of increasing complexity.</p>
          </section>
          
          <section>
            <h5><strong>Prompt #1</strong></h5>
            <p>Identify three fractions between 2 and 3.</p>
            <p><u>Teacher Notes:</u></p>
            <p>This prompt is intended to elicit the use of the benchmark strategy. Students will likely choose familiar fractions such as <abbr title="Two and One Fourth" class="abbr-frac">2 <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>4</sub></span></abbr>, <abbr title="Two and One Half" class="abbr-frac">2 <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>2</sub></span></abbr>, <abbr title="Two and Three Fourths" class="abbr-frac">2 <span class="frac"><sup>3</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>4</sub></span></abbr> demonstrating their comfort level with benchmarks. If they choose other fractions, such as <abbr title="Two and ONe Eigthteenth" class="abbr-frac">2 <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>18</sub></span></abbr> or <abbr title="Two and Teen Eleventh" class="abbr-frac">2 <span class="frac"><sup>10</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>11</sub></span></abbr>, it may indicate a deeper understanding. If the students are choosing equivalencies for half such as <abbr title="Two and Four Eighths" class="abbr-frac">2 <span class="frac"><sup>4</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>8</sub></span></abbr> and <abbr title="Two and three Sixths" class="abbr-frac">2 <span class="frac"><sup>3</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>6</sub></span></abbr>, encourage them to find 3 different quantities (not just different forms of <abbr title="Two and One Half" class="abbr-frac">2 <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>2</sub></span></abbr>). Students may benefit from a visual representation showing that these fractions are equivalent.</p>
            <p>If students struggle with finding three fractions, apply a context to help them visualize; for example, if we had more than 2 chocolate bars but less than 3, how much might we have? They may or may not wish to construct a model for the solution,but could be encouraged to do so.</p>
          </section>
          
          <section>
            <h5><strong>Prompt #2</strong></h5>
            <p>Identify a franction between <abbr title="One and One Half" class="abbr-frac">1 <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>2</sub></span></abbr> and 2.</p>
            <p><u>Teacher Notes:</u></p>
            <p>This prompt is intended to slightly push the student’s thinking because they are now starting at <abbr title="One and One Half" class="abbr-frac">1 <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>2</sub></span></abbr> rather than a whole number. Students will likely choose <abbr title="One and Three Fourths" class="abbr-frac">1 <span class="frac"><sup>3</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>4</sub></span></abbr>, although as in Prompt #1, less common responses may indicate a more fulsome understanding.</p>
          </section>
          
          <section>
            <h5><strong>Prompt #3</strong></h5>
            <p>Identify two fractions between <abbr title="One Twelfth" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>12</sub></span></abbr> and <abbr title="Nine Twelfths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>9</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>12</sub></span></abbr>.</p>
            <p><u>Teacher Notes:</u></p>
            <p>Students may easily answer this question (quickly identifying <abbr title="Seven Twelfths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>7</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>12</sub></span></abbr> and <abbr title="Eight Twelfths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>8</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>12</sub></span></abbr>; for example), however, through the use of the key questions this is a good time to review the importance of equi-partitioning and the meaning of unit fractions and how many parts make up the whole.</p>
            <p>These foundational concepts will support students in having a range of strategies for subsequent, more challenging, prompts.</p>
            <p>This prompt can also help to reinforce that the act of building models or representations can be a helpful strategy for problem solving and visual comparison.</p>
            <p style="text-indent:30px;"><strong>Paper folding:</strong> is a hands-on visual way to equally partition. Note, if the students have not used this strategy they will likely need time to explore paper folding.</p>
            <p style="text-indent:30px;"><strong>Number Line:</strong> is another model to help students visualize fractional quantities. The use of grid paper helps students to quickly and accurately partition. Students may need to be encouraged to further partition the square grids on the paper (into halves or thirds).</p>
          </section>
          
          <section>
            <h5><strong>Prompt #4</strong></h5>
            <p>Identify a fraction between <abbr title="Two Fifths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>2</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>5</sub></span></abbr> and <abbr title="Two Thirds" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>2</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>3</sub></span></abbr></p>
            <p><u>Teacher Notes:</u></p>
            <p>This prompt is intended to highlight common numerators. When the count or numerator is the same, the students must reason about the impact of the different denominator on the size of the fractional piece to compare the quantities. It is important that students know or are able to visualize that fifths are smaller than thirds. Stacked area models will help students visualize the size of the fractional units.</p>

            <p>Notice that <abbr title="Three Fifths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>3</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>5</sub></span></abbr> is between <abbr title="Two Fifths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>2</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>5</sub></span></abbr> and <abbr title="Two Thirds" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>2</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>3</sub></span></abbr>.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>By further partitioning students can notice that <abbr title="One Half" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>2</sub></span></abbr> and any equivalent fraction are also between <abbr title="Two Fifths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>2</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>5</sub></span></abbr> and <abbr title="Two Thirds" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>2</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>3</sub></span></abbr></p>

            </figure>
            <p>Students may reason that two fourths is between between two thirds and two fifths because 4 is between 3 and 5. This thinking is correct and having the students draw the above model will help consolidate that thinking. Although many adults may think that the only way to compare fractions is to determine a common denominator, the type of flexible thinking outlined above requires reasoning about the quantity represented by each fraction, which supports development of fraction number sense.</p>
          </section>
          
          <section>
            <h5><strong>Prompt #5</strong></h5>
            <p>Identify a fraction between <abbr title="One Third" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>3</sub></span></abbr> and <abbr title="Two Thirds" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>2</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>3</sub></span></abbr></p>
            <p><u>Teacher Notes:</u></p>
            <p>This prompt is intended to elicit comparison of fractions with common fractional units (denominators) and promotes thinking about equivalence. When the fractions have the same fractional unit (denominator), students must attend to the fractional amounts (numerators). Students may use a number line and their knowledge of equivalent fractions to generate smaller fractional amounts. Notice the line has been partitioned into sixths and <abbr title="Three Sixths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>3</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>6</sub></span></abbr> is between <abbr title="Two Sixths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>2</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>6</sub></span></abbr> and <abbr title="Four Sixths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>4</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>6</sub></span></abbr>. Further partitioning could result in twelfths and twenty-fourths.</p>

            <h5><strong>Prompt #6</strong></h5>
            <p>Identify four fractions between <abbr title="One Third" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>3</sub></span></abbr> and <abbr title="Two Thirds" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>2</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>3</sub></span></abbr></p>
            <p><u>Teacher Notes:</u></p>
            <p>This prompt is different from Prompt #5 because it requires the student to find four fractions between <abbr title="One Third" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>3</sub></span></abbr> and <abbr title="Two Thirds" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>2</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>3</sub></span></abbr>, which will push them to consider further partitioning a unit fraction.</p>
