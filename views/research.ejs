              Three literature reviews were completed during the course of the research project. A
              number of brief research summaries were developed from these literature reviews to
              allow educators to identify key instructional decisions known to improve student
              learning. They include suggestions for precise classroom instruction.</p>

              Based on Paying Attention to Fractions and related research, this Adobe Connect<br/>
              session will explore the role that unit fractions play in developing a solid fraction number<br/>
              sense across K-12 learning.<br/>
              In this session you will have opportunities to:<br/><br/>
              
               understand what a unit fraction is and how this changes the way we think about fractions;<br/>
               examine how unit fractions can support learning across number systems and algebraic contexts;<br/>
               develop deeper understanding of fraction as a number by engaging in the actions of partitioning, iterating and disembedding.

              Multiplication and Division with Fractions Virtual Learning Session<br/>
              Multiplication and division of fractions is frequently taught solely based upon the<br/>
              algorithms. This strategy obscures the mathematics, particularly in the case of division<br/>
              where multiplication is used. Research in Ontario classrooms has uncovered the<br/>
              importance of purposeful representations for fractions instruction, especially in the<br/>
              learning of multiplication and division of fractions. This session will explore these<br/>
              learnings through classroom ready tasks.<br/>

              Over six years of research a range of qualitative and quantitative data was collected<br/>
              about fractions learning and teaching and professional learning. This data is shared in a<br/>
              variety of documents and videos. The two videos included detail the history of the<br/>
              development of the Fractions Learning Pathways and the research findings.<br/><br/>
