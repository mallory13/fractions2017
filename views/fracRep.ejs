          <p>Students circulate around the room and review the different representations. Students consider which representation they think most clearly shows the fraction, and indicate their preference by placing a sticky note with their name by
            their first choice. Ask students to be prepared to discuss any similarities or differences they notice between the representations of <abbr title="Four Tenths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>4</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>10</sub></span></abbr>
            and <abbr title="Two Fifths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>2</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>5</sub></span></abbr>.</p>

          <p>Guide the class to organize and name the different types of representations students preferred. Ask students who put their name on a sticky note by each particular representation to explain why they think that one is the most effective.
            Use prompts such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What did you find particularly helpful about this representation?</li>
            <li>I am noticing a lot of students selected (this) model. Why do you think so many of us chose that representation?</li>
            <li>Why didn’t you pick (the most popular)?</li>
            <li>I am interested in this representation…. (least picked)</li>
            <li>One of my favourite representations of <abbr title="Two Fifths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>2</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>5</sub></span></abbr> is (show a representation that students did not show <abbr title="For example">e.g.</abbr>,
              position on a number line). Why do you think I like this type of representation?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Push their thinking for each representation by using some of the following questions:</p>

          <h4 class="title-dark">Key Questions:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>So what does the 4 (2) represent?</li>
            <li>What does the 10 (5) represent?</li>
            <li>How are the 4 and the 10 (2 and 5) related?</li>
            <li>Why is it important for this to be partitioned into equal parts?</li>
            <li>What do equal parts mean in this model?</li>
            <li>Where do you think this representation (one they did not show) would belong?</li>
          </ul>
