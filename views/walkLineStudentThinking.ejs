                <p> Researcher: Six what?</p>
                <p>Student 2: Tiles. So three of six tiles would be a half.</p>

                <p>Student 1: Half way to the one.</p>
                <p>Researcher: So this is like one sixth of the way to one if we use what you said. You said, ‘That is one half of the way to one.’</p>
