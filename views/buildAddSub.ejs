    <h2>Math Teaching for Learning: Building to Addition and Subtraction of Fractions</h2>
  </section>

  <section class="row">
    <p>A thorough examination of the research highlights a development of instruction to support student understanding of fractions addition and subtraction from primary through to intermediate grades; although the learning progression is not
      linear, there are some strongly interconnected components which support student understanding of subsequent concepts.</p>

    <h3>Building on Student Intuitions to Transition to Addition and Subtraction of Fractions</h3>
    <p>Lamon (1999), as referenced in Brown and Quinn (2006) states that:</p>

    <blockquote>
      studies have shown that if children are given the time to develop their own reasoning for at least three years without being taught standard algorithms for operations with fractions and ratios, then a dramatic increase in their reasoning
      abilities occurred, including their proportional thinking (5).
    </blockquote>

    <p>This reasoning can be developed through high quality tasks of representing, comparing and ordering. Therefore, as students transition from representing, comparing, and ordering fractions into more formal approaches for adding and subtracting
      fractions it is critical to assess if they possess the knowledge and skills of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>representing fractions</li>
      <li>comparing and ordering fractions</li>
      <li>equivalent fractions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Ensuring that students have this prior knowledge will allow them to have greater sense-making opportunities. If students understand that the sum of <abbr title="one twelfth" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>12</sub></span></abbr>
      and <abbr title="seven eighths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>7</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>8</sub></span></abbr> is closest to 1 by reasoning that <abbr title="one twelfth" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>12</sub></span></abbr>
      is very close to 0, while <abbr title="seven eighths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>7</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>8</sub></span></abbr> is very close to 1 then they will be able to judge the reasonableness of their answers to
      fractions tasks. Huinker (2002), as referenced in Petit et al. (2010), cites flexible use of fraction representations as contributing to increased ability to reason about fraction operations. Stacked number lines are one example of a
      representation that could be used.</p>

            <p>Although underutilized in North American instruction, linear representations such as the number line support the study of equivalent fractions, as any point on the line can represent an infinite number of equivalent fractions.</p>

          <td>
            <p>Premature teaching of the standard algorithm for finding equivalence, by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the same number, reinforces the idea that a fraction is comprised of two whole numbers rather than representing a
              single value (Empson & Levi, 2011; Petit et al., 2010) and should be deemphasized.</p>
