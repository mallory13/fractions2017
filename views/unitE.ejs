      <p>When composing and decomposing fractions using unit fractions, students develop fractional number sense (quantity) that connects to their prior experience with whole numbers.</p>

      <h3>Background</h3>

      <p>A unit fraction is the base unit of any fraction and always has a numerator of 1; for example, <abbr title="one fourth" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>4</sub></span></abbr>, <abbr title="one fifth"
          class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>15</sub></span></abbr>, <abbr title="one twenty-third" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>23</sub></span></abbr> are all unit
        fractions. Every fraction can be decomposed into unit fractions. For example, <abbr title="three fourths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>3</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>4</sub></span></abbr> is 3 one-fourth units (so one-fourth is
        the unit fraction and we are thinking about 3 of them). Partitioning a model involves determining and creating a unit fraction.</p>

      <p>Consider the fraction one and three-fourths. This number can be decomposed using a unit fraction.</p>

          <p>A student may say, â€œOne whole is the same as 4 one-fourth units. I added another 2 one-fourth units to the whole to obtain 6 one-fourth units. So I can see that 6 one-fourth units is equal to one and two-fourths. </p>

        <p>Use of unit fractions supports a deeper understanding of quantity. Notice that in the student dialogue above, early understanding of equivalency is being developed, <abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr>, one and one-half is the same as
          six-fourths. Counting by naming the unit fractions helps students to see the parts of the fraction when composing and decomposing. Notice that both counting unit fractions and composing and decomposing fractions are pre-cursors to addition
          and subtraction. For example, composing 6 one-fourth units is the same as adding 6 one-fourth units together to make one and one-half.</p>

            <p>These tasks emerged out of the fraction research. Teachers may wish to use them as diagnostic or summative assessments, exit cards, number talk prompts, or additional practice questions. By considering both the specifics of the cell
              and student use of purposeful models, teachers can support students in acquiring a strong conceptual understanding.</p>
