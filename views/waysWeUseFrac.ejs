        <h2>Math for Teaching: Ways We Use Fractions</h2>
        <p>A fraction is a number, which can tell us about the relationship between two quantities. These two quantities provide information about the parts, the units we are considering and the whole. Determining the whole is important when working with fractions.</p>

        <p>Each of these fraction meanings is included in the Ontario curriculum. Although within the curriculum for specific grades students are not expected to use all meanings, they sometimes use a mathematically correct fraction which is unexpected within the lesson focus. When educators understand each of these  meanings, they are better able to assess student thinking as correct as well as connect that knowledge to the lesson focus.</p>
