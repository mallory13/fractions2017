      <p>Understanding that between any two fractions there are an infinite number of fractions (fraction density) is important. Students should use a variety of strategies for identifying such fractions. This helps students to compare fractions and
        assess fractions for equivalence.</p>

      <h3>Background</h3>

      <p>Comparing and ordering fractions allows students to develop a sense of fraction as quantity, as well as a sense of the size of a fraction, both necessary prior knowledge components for understanding fraction operations (Johanning, 2011).</p>

      <p>Comparing and ordering fractions with different fractional units (or denominators) leads students to identify the need for equivalent fractions. When students determine an equivalent fraction they are changing the unit of measure by either
        splitting or merging the partitions of the original fraction. The following illustration demonstrates these concepts using an area model:</p>

        <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 text-center">
          <p>Merging to determine an equivalent fraction for <abbr title="six eighths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>6</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>8</sub></span></abbr> </p>

          </figure>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>The exploration of equivalence allows students to develop an understanding of equivalent fractions as simply being a different way of naming the same quantity; it also supports them in viewing the fraction as a numeric value. A solid
        understanding of equivalence helps students with fractions operations, especially addition and subtraction.</p>

            <h4>Generating Fractions between Two Numbers (Fraction Density)</h4>
            <p>This is a set of progressive prompts that will elicit the use of various strategies used to find fractions between two numbers. The prompts, when used in sequence, support students in choosing a strategy based upon the fractions being
              considered. Encourage students to build models/representations and create contexts to aid in visualization.</p>

            <p>These tasks emerged out of the fraction research. Teachers may wish to use them as diagnostic or summative assessments, exit cards, number talk prompts, or additional practice questions. By considering both the specifics of the cell
              and student use of purposeful models, teachers can support students in acquiring a strong conceptual understanding.</p>
