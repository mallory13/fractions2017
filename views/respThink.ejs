            <p>When educators work with a partner or in small groups to examine and annotate student work, it allows for student thinking to be unpacked – their understandings, strategies and transitional conceptions. Here, student thinking from a Grade 3 classroom, a Grade 7/8 classroom and a Grade 9 classroom is shared for educators to use in their own professional learning, individually or school-wide.</p>

        <p>Into a Grade 7/8 classroom, the following question was posed to students: “Out of one pan of brownies, Sandy ate <abbr title="one fourth"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></abbr> and Pat ate <abbr title="one sixth"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub></abbr>/ What fraction of the brownies did Sandy and Pat eat altogether? Write a number sentence to explain.” Students were provided with paper to fold to solve the task. One student folded the paper as shown. Note the space between a one-sixth fold and a one-fourth fold (when folded as shown to the right) is one-twelfth of the area of the paper, which is the common unit. The student was unable to make this connection and wrote the number sentence as <abbr title="one fourth"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></abbr> + <abbr title="one sixth"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub> </abbr>= <abbr title="tow tenth"><sup>2</sup>/<sub>10</sub></abbr>.</p>

Why is it named <abbr title="one fourth"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></abbr>?” This question is intended to draw students’ attention to the equi-partitioning.</li>
        
            <li><span class="color-gr">❖</span> If students understand that the regions should be the same size but are unsure of how to name the smaller fractional regions, ask, “Would it be possible to fold the other segments to create equal partitions?” This question is intended to support students in seeing that fractional regions can be split or partitioned into equivalent fractional segments.</li>
        
            <li><span class="color-gr">❖</span> If students understand equi-partitioning and have folded their paper to create a common fractional unit of twelfths but are unsure how their answer compares with another response of <abbr title="ten twenty-fourths "><sup>10</sup>/<sub>24</sub></abbr>, ask, “Would it be possible to fold your model to create twenty-four equal partitions, or twenty-fourths?

        <h3 class="color-lil">Grade 9</h3>
        <p>A Grade 9 student was asked to solve for x in the equation <abbr title="two thirds"><sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub></abbr> x + 5 = 7 + <abbr title="four fifths"><sup>4</sup>/<sub>5</sub></abbr> x</p>
        <p>The student completed the following solution:</p>

            <img src="/images/pdf-img/beingResp7.png" alt="" class="img-responsive margin-auto" />
        </figure>
        
        <p>Note that in the first line of the solution, the student multiplied the left side by 3 and the right side by 5.</p>
        
        <p>Probing questions may include the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="color-gr">❖</span> Explain what procedure you used to create the first line in your solution.</li>
            <li><span class="color-gr">❖</span> If the student doesn’t realize that he or she is working with an equation and must perform the same calculation on all terms to preserve equality, ask, “Is this new equation equivalent to the original equation? How do you know?”</li>
            <li><span class="color-gr">❖</span> If the student understands that the procedure should have been to multiply all terms by the same number but can’t identify or justify the number, ask, “Would it be possible to write the equation so that each term is a fraction? If we wanted to have a common fraction unit for each term, what fraction unit (or denominator) could we use?” This question is intended to support students in seeing that multiplying by a common denominator to clear the fractions is really a shortcut. The mathematical justification is that if each term was first written in fraction form with a common denominator, it would be <abbr title="ten fifteenths"><sup>10</sup>/<sub>15</sub></abbr> x + <abbr title="seventy five fifteenths"><sup>75</sup>/<sub>15</sub></abbr> = <abbr title="one hundred five fifteenths"><sup>105</sup>/<sub>15</sub></abbr> + <abbr title="twele fifteenths"><sup>12</sup>/<sub>15</sub></abbr> x</abbr>. Then, since each term is based on the same fractional unit, we only need to equate the numerators. So the equation becomes 10x + 75 = 105 + 12 x.</li>
