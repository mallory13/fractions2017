    <h2>Math Teaching for Learning: Developing Fraction Number Sense</h2>
    <p>Students who have a strong understanding of fraction as number are better equipped to work with fraction operations. There are a number of factors which contribute to a student’s fraction number sense, including understanding:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>multiple meanings of fractions (part-whole, part-part, quotient, operator).</li>
      <li>benchmark fractions, such as <abbr title="one fourth" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>4</sub></span></abbr>, <abbr title="one half" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>2</sub></span></abbr>,
        <abbr title="one third" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>3</sub></span></abbr>, <abbr title="three fourths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>3</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>4</sub></span></abbr>.</li>
      <li>multiple strategies for reasoning and proving.</li>

            <p>To help students understand fractions deeply we need to address more than a simple understanding of part-whole relationships by expanding to:</p>

            <p>Charalambous et al. (2010) found that “engaging students with multiple fraction constructs catalyzes learning, not only because each fraction construct captures part of the broader notion of fractions but also because moving from one
              construct to another reinforces understanding” (142).</p>

    <p>Consider how these three factors play a role in the following scenario:</p>
    <p>Students are asked to “identify two fractions on a number line that would sum to approximately one but not exactly one”.</p>
    <p>Students may arrive at a sum which is slightly less than one by considering:</p>
