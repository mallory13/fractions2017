    <p>In Grade 4, students will:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>represent fractions using concrete materials, words, and standard fractional notation, and explain the meaning of the denominator as the number of the fractional parts of a whole or a set, and the numerator as the number of fractional
        parts being considered; </li>
      <li>compare and order fractions (i.e., halves, thirds, fourths, fifths, tenths) by considering the size and the number of fractional parts (e.g., <abbr title="Four Fifths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>4</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>5</sub></span></abbr>
        is greater than <abbr title="Three Fifths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>3</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>5</sub></span></abbr> because there are more parts in <abbr title="Four Fifths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>4</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>5</sub></span></abbr>;
        <abbr title="One Quarter" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>4</sub></span></abbr> is greater than <abbr title="One Fifth" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>5</sub></span></abbr>
        because the size of the part is larger in <abbr title="One Quarter" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>4</sub></span></abbr>); </li>
      <li>compare fractions to the benchmarks of 0, <abbr title="One Half" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>2</sub></span></abbr> and 1 ( e.g., <abbr title="One Eighth" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>8</sub></span></abbr>
        is closer to 0 than <abbr title="One Half" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>2</sub></span></abbr>; <abbr title="Three Fifths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>3</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>5</sub></span></abbr>
        is more than <abbr title="One Half" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>2</sub></span></abbr>); </li>
      <li>demonstrate and explain the relationship between equivalent fractions, using concrete materials (e.g., fraction circles, fraction strips, pattern blocks) and drawings; </li>
      <li>count forward by halves,thirds, fourths, and tenths to beyond one whole, using concrete materials and numberlines (e.g., use fraction circles to count fourths: "One fourth, two fourths, three fourths, four fourths, five fourths, six
        fourths"); </li>
      <li>determine and explain, through investigation, the relationship between fractions (i.e., halves, fifths, tenths) and decimals to tenths, using a variety of tools (e.g., concrete materials, drawings, calculators) and strategies (e.g.,
        decompose <abbr title="Two Fifths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>2</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>5</sub></span></abbr> into <abbr title="Four Tenths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>4</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>10</sub></span></abbr>
        by dividing each fifth into two equal part to show that <abbr title="Two Fifths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>2</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>5</sub></span></abbr> can be represented as 0.4).</li>

    <p>Understanding opportunities to revisit or reinforce understanding across the strands allows teachers to plan more effectively.</p>
    <p>In Number Sense, students will:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>represent, compare, and order decimal numbers to tenths, using a variety of tools and using standard decimal notation</i>
      </li>
      <li><i>count forward by tenths from any decimal number expressed to one decimal place, using concrete materials and number lines</i>

      <li><i>add and subtract decimal numbers to tenths, using concrete materials and student-generated algorithms</i></li>

        <p class="col-dark-blue">Students should understand that decimal numbers are fractions with a denominator that is a power of ten and a numerator which is written to the right of the decimal. E.g., 0.6 = <abbr title="Six Tenths" class="abbr-frac"><span

          <li>Show the position of the hands of an analogue clock if it is 'half-past nine'. Indicate where the 'half'
            shows up in the clock. </li>
