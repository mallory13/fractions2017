<p>Prior to engaging in collaborative action research with teacher teams and students in Ontario classrooms, this literature review was undertaken to provide a synthesis of existing knowledge from the field of educational research focused on the learning and teaching of fractions. The authors of this study are educational researchers in Ontario, Canada. They have experience as practicing teachers, teacher educators and academic researchers with ongoing intensive work in classrooms with teachers and students. This literature review provides the foundation for continued Canadian research in the learning and teaching of the addition and subtraction of fractions.</p>
<p>The literature review begins with an extensive examination of foundational concepts of fractions as the groundwork for understanding operations of fractions. It is clear from the research that issues and challenges in the learning and teaching of fractions operations (adding and subtracting) stem from fragile and superficial understandings of these foundational concepts of fractions.</p>
<p>This literature review is organized under the following headings: </p>
<ol type="I">
  <li>research on the foundations of fractions, </li>
  <li>research on learning fractions, and </li>
  <li>research on teaching fractions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, the literature review ends with a discussion of the implications for Canadian research directions.</p> -->
<h2 id="intro" class="col-bl">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>The following literature review discusses current and seminal research on
fractions operations, specifically fractions multiplication and division. This
review builds on a previous literature review of the foundations of fractions,
Foundations to Learning and Teaching Fractions: Addition and Subtraction
Literature Review (Bruce, Chang, Flynn & Yearley, 2013). This operations
literature extends beyond the foundations review to offer new insights into
the challenges of understanding fractions operations, specifically
multiplication and division, and promising teaching practices that support
students in a deep understanding of these procedures and their conceptual
underpinnings. This document begins by outlining the methods used to
conduct the literature review and then provides a comprehensive discussion
of the central themes and key issues identified in the research to date on
fractions multiplication and division.</p>
<h2 id="" class="col-bl align-left">Review Methods</h2>
<p>To develop this document, a comprehensive literature review examining
research on multiplication and division of fractions was completed. Relevant
articles were retrieved, read and summarized. A database of reviewed articles
was created and includes article citations, abstracts, brief summaries and
additional notes (see appendix). Articles were selected from literature searches
using the key words: “Fractions Operations,” “Fractions and Multiplication,”
“Fractions and Division,” “Fractions and Multiplications and Division,” and
“Multiplication and Division of Fractions” (with a focus on the latter two) in
the research database ProQuest.</p>

<p>TThe number of articles identified in these key word searches may appear large
upon first consideration, but in fact this set is significantly smaller in size and
scope compared to the total articles in consideration for the Foundations to
Learning and Teaching Fractions: Addition and Subtraction Literature Review.
Some articles were rejected as they were insufficient in their rigour of
methods or in the sample size. Quantitative articles with clear and valid
research methods were selected to identify trends and large-scale findings.
Qualitative articles were selected to develop a fine-grained understanding of
the issues of challenge and promise related to fractions operations. In total,
73 articles were thoroughly reviewed and summarized in our database, as well
as 4 current and highly regarded books with sections devoted to
multiplication and division with fractions.</p>
<h3 id="" class="col-bl align-left">Overview</h3>
<p>Fractions are relational representations that can be perceived as continuous or
discreet quantities, and are an integral part of our everyday lives from birth.
The emphasis on whole number counting at an early age tends to reinforce a
strong concept of numbers as whole numbers. When students are then, much
later, introduced to non-integer number types such as fractions, they may find
it difficult to transition to thinking about a continuous system or quantities
that vary from „the whole‟. “Research indicates that children have difficulty
integrating fractions into their already well-established understanding of
whole numbers (Staflyidou & Vosniadou, 2004; Vamvakoussi & Vosniadou,
2010; Ni & Zhou, 2005), and even adults at community colleges seem to lack
fundamental understanding of how to use fractions (Stigler et. al., 2010)”
(DeWolf, Bassok & Holyoak, 2013, p. 389).</p>
<p>If foundational concepts and understanding of fractions are not addressed
effectively, the groundwork is not in place for further manipulation of
fractions and fractions ideas, such as considering operations contexts and
procedures. Multiplication and division of fractions has proven to be a
particularly difficult area to both teach and learn. This difficulty is also related
to the complexity of fractions themselves as a „multifaceted construct‟. Further,
student misunderstandings of the meaning behind algorithmic „shortcuts‟ with
fractions, can lead to later problems in other areas of mathematics, such as
algebra. </p>
<p>In this literature review, we begin by examining research on the conceptual
underpinnings of multiplication and division with fractions. We then identify
the current prevailing strategies for teaching multiplication and division with
fractions and the related common student and teacher misconceptions. We
then outline some of the more effective models and promising practices for teaching multiplication and division with fractions. In the final section we offer
some recommendations for consideration and further discussion. </p>
<h2 id="" class="col-bl">2. Conceptual Underpinnings of Multiplication and Division
with Fractions</h2>
<p>Multiplication and division with fractions is more complex than whole number
multiplication and division (Lamon, 1999). When we consider that, in addition
to the many interpretations of multiplication or division, there are also five
meanings/interpretations of fractions depending on the context, we can see
how complex these operations are for students. (The five subconstructs - or
meanings of fractions, including part-whole, part-part, operator, quotient, and
measure - are outlined in detail in the Foundations to Learning and Teaching
Fractions: Addition and Subtraction Literature Review, Bruce et al., 2013, and
discussed elsewhere in the current literature review.) </p>
<p>It is important to understand what is occurring when we multiply two
fractions. In an area (array) model, we consider multiplication as the shared
space of two numbers. In whole numbers, the shared space of 3 columns and
6 rows is 18 cells (3 x 6 = 18). With fractions, we can also think about the
shared space using a partitioned area model. Important for the discussion of
fraction division models below, the product of length x width (or AxB) can
also be called a Cartesian product. In a fractions example, the shared space of <abbr title=""><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub></abbr> of the area and <abbr title=""><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub></abbr> of the area is <abbr title=""><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>18</sub></abbr> of the whole area (<abbr title=""><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub></abbr> x <abbr title=""><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub></abbr> = <abbr title=""><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>18</sub></abbr>). This is
illustrated in the following diagram:</p>
<figure id="fig1"  class="center">
  <figcaption>Figure 1: Area model of whole number multiplication</figcaption>
  <img src="/images/pdf-img/multDiv2.png" alt=""/> 
</figure>
<figure id="fig2"  class="center">
  <figcaption>Figure 2: Area model of multiplication of fractions</figcaption>
  <img src="/images/pdf-img/multDiv3.png" alt=""/> 
</figure>
<p>In addition to the area model, whole number multiplication by skip counting
can be adapted for fraction multiplication. Consider the following example of
whole number skip counting (or repeated addition: 3+3+3+3+3+3 =18, or
6x3 =18:
</p>
<figure id="fig3"  class="center">
  <figcaption>Figure 3: Number line model of whole number skip counting</figcaption>
  <img src="/images/pdf-img/multDiv4.png" alt=""/> 
</figure>
<p>For fractions, the line can run from 0 to 1 and the unit fraction can be used
for repeated addition. Thinking about 18 units partitioned equally means that
each jump of 3 is one sixth (the unit). In this example, we are now adding, or
counting by, one-sixth units: 1 one-sixth, 2 one-sixths, 3 one-sixths, 4 onesixths,
5 one-sixths, 6 one-sixths. This is the same as or at least similar to 6x<abbr title=""><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub></abbr></p>

<p>The following photo is a student work example of repeated fraction addition
using jumps along a number line. The students were posed the following
problem: There are 3 meters of ribbon. Each decoration needs <abbr title=""><sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub></abbr> of a meter of ribbon. How many decorations can you make? </p>

<p>Three multiplication strategies (meaning, ways of thinking about
multiplication) applied to both fractions and other number systems are
outlined in the table below: (See Empson, page 189)</p>

    </tr>

</table>
<p>It is also important to understand what happens when we divide two
fractions. The complexity of this operation is apparent when we consider the
many interpretations for the division of fractions. There are, in fact, several
different ways to think about, or models for, division, according to Yim (2010)
and Sinicrope, Mick and Kolb (2002). Sinicrope, Mick and Kolb (2002) explain
that we may “divide to determine how many times one quantity is contained
in a given quantity, to share, to determine what the unit is, to determine the
original amount, and to determine a dimension for an array” (p. 161). As with
multiplication of fractions, it is helpful to relate our knowledge of whole
number operations to fraction operations, and, therefore, to consider models
that can be used for both division of whole numbers and division of fractions.
The following table outlines division strategies as they apply to other number
systems and as they relate more specifically to fractions:</p>

<p>(Sinicrope, Mick & Kolb, 2002)</p>
<p>The follow example further expands on the last strategy in the table above,
“Inverse of multiplication.” Since division is the inverse of multiplication, and a
Cartesian product is calculated in a model for fraction multiplication (as in the
area model described above), it makes sense that the inverse of a Cartesian
product is calculated in a fraction division model. The following diagrams
outline this inverse model:</p>

<p>(Reproduced from reference to Sinicrope, Mick & Kolb (2002) in Yim, 2010, p. 107)</p>
<p>In addition to the models described above, which apply to both division with
whole numbers and with fractions, there are two strategies that relate
specifically to the division of fractions: division as the determination of the
unit rate and division as the inverse of multiplication (Sinicrope, Mick & Kolb,
p. 153). </p>
<p>Like Sinicrope, Mick and Kolb (2002), Yim (2010) considered the first three
strategies for division of fractions in a study of 10- and 11-year-olds. A review
of previous work on the division of fractions indicated that there was
extensive research into the measurement and partitive models of division, as
described above, but not as much on the product-and-factors model (“the inverse of a Cartesian product”). The study, therefore, focused on the latter in
an effort to better understand the inverse of a Cartesian product model
(finding the missing dimension of a rectangular area) using pictorial
procedures like the one shown above. Most of the students in the study were
able to develop strategies for creating pictorial procedures. Strategies
included converting either a dimension or the area to 1 (i.e. working with
friendly numbers), which involves building on prior knowledge of proportional
thinking about the area of a rectangle, as well as prior knowledge of
multiplication and addition of fractions. Yim concluded that solving division
problems in this way should prove helpful for students to better understand
the meaning of fraction division algorithms (p. 119).</p>
<p>Lamon (1999) considered the operators that underlie fraction multiplication
and division in her book on teaching fractions for understanding. She
recognizes the challenges in multiplying and dividing fractions as she
describes both multiplication and division of fractions as the composition of
two operators (e.g., in multiplication, one combines two fractions: <abbr title=""><sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub></abbr> of (<abbr title=""><sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></abbr> of).</p>
<p>An area model is helpful in illustrating this way of thinking about
multiplication. To solve this problem, a rectangle (the whole) would be divided
into fourths. Three of these fourths would be shaded in (representing <abbr title=""><sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></abbr>). Then, the same rectangle (the whole) would be divided into thirds. Two thirds of the three fourths would be shaded in (representing <abbr title=""><sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub></abbr> of <abbr title=""><sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></abbr> of 1). The
overlapping area would represent the answer, in this case, <abbr title=""><sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub></abbr>.</p>

<p>In division, one combines two fractions of 1: the question <abbr title=""><sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></abbr> divided by <abbr title=""><sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub></abbr> can
be thought about as „how many <abbr title=""><sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub></abbr> of 1 are in there in <abbr title=""><sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></abbr> of 1?‟. Again, an
area model can help with conceptualizing this. Imagine a rectangular whole.
Since the fractions involved are thirds and fourths, partition the rectangle into
twelfths (fourths drawn in one direction and thirds in the other). Two thirds of
this area is 8 squares. Three fourths of the whole (1) is then shaded in, and
two thirds of 1 is counted out, as described below:</p>

<p><b>Informal knowledge students bring to fractions: the case of equal sharing</b></p>
<p>Equal sharing is an essential concept that underlies multiplication and division
with fractions. Equal sharing involves dividing something into equal parts, for
example, breaking a cookie into equal halves to share between two people. </p>
<p>Even very young children are able to share equally and recognize when
something has been shared unfairly, or unequally. Some researchers maintain
that fractions appear to be largely intuitive for very young children, who have
experience and familiarity with – and curiosity about – the quantities between
whole numbers (Nora Newcombe, Personal communication, August 2014). </p>
<p>Studies show, for example, that the ability to understand fractions as
multiplicative structures stems from equal sharing problems, much like in
partitive division, as discussed above (Empson, Junk, Dominguez & Turner,
2006). “Findings show that children‟s attempts to make sense of equal sharing
elicited relationships among fractions, ratio, multiplication, and division,
evidenced in how children share things exhaustively and equally among
sharers” (pp. 23-24). Learning fractions often begins with equal sharing
problems, where students divide up a certain amount of something among a
certain number of friends (Empson, 2001). In these types of problems,
students will spontaneously create examples of fraction equivalence, as they
“naturally move toward the goal of partitioning or transforming shares into
the biggest possible pieces” (p. 421). For example, in the equal sharing
problem „24 children share 8 pancakes equally,‟ students were observed to
divide each pancake into 24 equal parts (using the smallest pieces), but then
considered how they could distribute the largest possible pieces amongst the
group, (e.g., recognizing 24 as a multiple of 8 meant students partitioned
pancakes into thirds) a direct application of fraction equivalence (Empson,
2001, p. 421).</p>
<h3 id="" class="col-bl align-left">Procedural vs. conceptual approaches</h3>
<p>Often in classrooms in North America, procedural approaches to operations
with fractions are emphasized over conceptual approaches (see Hasemann,
1981; this is also further discussed in Section 4 on student challenges and
misconceptions). A procedural approach involves learning rules for manipulating the symbolic notation in order to produce an answer. Procedural
knowledge can be defined as “„know how to do it‟ knowledge” (McCormick,
1997, p. 143) or as the “action sequences for solving problems.” (RittleJohnson
& Alibali, 1999, p. 175). A conceptual approach, on the other hand,
provides students with the means to explore the meaning of the operation on
a conceptual level, often involving exploration with hands-on materials.
Conceptual knowledge can be defined as “relationships among „items‟ of
knowledge” (McCormick, 1997, p. 143) or as “explicit or implicit understanding
of the principles that govern a domain and of the interrelations between
pieces of knowledge in a domain” (Rittle-Johnson & Alibali, 1999, p. 175).
Forrester and Chinnappan (2010) consider the differences between
approaching a fraction multiplication problem procedurally and approaching it
conceptually. A procedural approach to solving a problem would be to simply
multiply the numerators together, multiply the denominators together and
simplify. A conceptual approach would involve partitioning or cutting an area
into a certain number of parts to find x of y (p. 187). Their study found that
pre-service teachers mainly relied on the procedural approach, which led to
errors and an inability to catch and correct mistakes. In other words, this
research (along with many other studies discussed throughout this literature
review) shows that an understanding of the concepts underlying multiplication
and division with fractions outlined above is beneficial for deep understanding
of concepts, as well as application and retention of procedures. </p>
<h2 id="" class="col-bl">3. Current Teaching Strategies for Multiplication and Division
with Fractions</h2>
<p>In order to better understand the challenges students commonly face in
learning to multiply and divide with fractions, we need to understand how
multiplication and division with fractions are commonly presented in
classrooms in North America. The literature – although slim – reveals some
prevalent trends, including an emphasis on procedures over concepts; an
emphasis on the part-whole meaning of fractions (combined with a lack of
explicit attention to other meanings); limited use of representations of
multiplication and division with fractions; as well as insufficient instructional
time. </p>
<p><i>Privileging Procedures</i></p>
<p>Without conceptual understanding, students may be merely engaging in the
“meaningless following of rules of calculation” (Keijzer & Terwel, 2001, p. 55).
Multiplication and division with fractions typically involves all sorts of
procedural and rule-based actions, such as “invert and multiply” (Rule &
Hallagan, 2006). Many have noted that, while conceptualizing multiplication of
fractions is difficult, the algorithms are relatively simple to memorize and
apply. However, appropriate application of the algorithm does not mean a
student understands the process; the traditional invert-and-multiply algorithm,
for example, doesn‟t require an understanding of the processes behind
division of fractions. (This rule also loses sight of the role of the divisor, an
important piece that is often overlooked, according to Coughlin (2010); when
solving word problems, for example, interpreting the solution requires
reference to the divisor, since a remainder without reference to the divisor is
meaningless.) Students who do not understand the reasoning behind the
procedure may not always be able to apply it successfully or always know
when to use it (Tsankova & Pjanic, 2009), and will eventually struggle when simply being able to follow the rule becomes insufficient (when solving more
complex fraction problems, for example) (Wu, 2001)</p>
<p>There is evidence in the research that teachers tend to focus instruction on
procedures for multiplying and dividing fractions, with less attention to the
concepts underlying these procedures (how the procedures act on the
fractional quantities and the reasoning behind the operations and/or
algorithms themselves) (Baroody & Hume, 1991; Li, 2008; Petit, Laird &
Marsden, 2010; Phillip, 2000; Rule & Hallagan, 2006). This has been attributed
to at least two issues: First, research indicates that effectively teaching the
underlying concepts is more challenging and requires a deeper content
understanding than teaching the rules alone (Vale and Davies, 2007). And
second, researchers have found that even when teachers possess solid
content knowledge and conceptual understanding themselves, prospective
teachers struggled to represent fractions conceptually (with pictures, diagrams
or in word problems) (Lo and Luo, 2012). Thus the problem is multi-layered
and requires systematic opportunities for teacher professional learning in
order to support teachers in developing effective strategies and models for
representing fractions concepts in ways that are meaningful and helpful to
their students. </p>
<p><i>Cultural Differences in Curricula for Teaching Fractions</i></p>
<p>Analyses of curricula (in the form of textbook content) also help to document
common approaches to the teaching of multiplication and division with
fractions, including cultural differences. Son & Senk (2010) set out to perform
a comparative analysis of curricula from South Korea and the USA. They cite a
great deal of research indicating that grade 4-8 students in Asian countries,
including South Korea, outperform students in economically similar European
and North American countries. Textbooks from each country were analysed to
assess the differences in the presentation of multiplication and division of
fractions. The analysis revealed a significantly higher number of lessons and problems on the division of fractions in the Korean curriculum than the US
one; there seems to be more instructional time spent on multiplication and
division with fractions in Korea. Another difference is in the development of
“conceptual understanding and procedural fluency” (p. 119). The researchers
found that in the US curricula, instruction focuses on conceptual
understanding separately from procedural fluency (e.g., the algorithms for
multiplication and division), whereas in the Korean curriculum, the two are
developed simultaneously. This study also found that American curricula had
limited focus on the different meanings of multiplication and division with
fractions (“the meaning of multiplication of fractions mainly as finding a
portion of a portion and division of fractions solely using the measurement or
repeated subtraction interpretation”) (p. 134). In contrast, the Korean curricula
uncovered and addressed multiple meanings of each operation. These
observations are particularly interesting given that Korea has been reported to
have higher mean achievement than the US. </p>
<h2 id="" class="col-bl">4. Student Challenges and Misconceptions</h2>
<p>Learning fractions, in general, is a serious challenge and obstacle in the
“mathematical maturation of children” (Charalambous & Pitta-Pantazi, 2007:
293). Multiplication and division with fractions remains an area of struggle for
students across populations in North America; for example, a study focusing
on students with learning disabilities from junior-high to high school found
that deficits in fraction terminology and basic fraction operations were both in
the top 6 most frequently reported problem areas (McLeod & Armstrong,
1982). Although this study is now over 30 years old, current research,
discussed below, concurs with the findings of McLeod and Armstrong.</p>
<h3 id="" class="col-bl align-left">Why is understanding operations with fractions so difficult? </h3>
<p>To answer this question, we must look at the difficulties students have with
fractions overall. Hasemann (1981), for example, compared the challenge of
understanding operations with fractions to performing operations with whole
numbers in a study of students aged 12 to 15 in Germany. Hasemann points
out that fractions are more challenging because they are used far less often,
and the written notation of fractions is more complex. In addition, ordering
and comparing fractions (e.g., along a number line) is more difficult because
we are considering multiple digits (numerator and denominator) that
represent one single quantity. Further, when fractions are involved in
operations, the rules and algorithms are more complicated. </p>
<p>Further to these complexities, fractions also possess several meanings (known
in the research as “subconstructs”) depending on their context and use,
namely part-whole, part-part, operator, quotient, and measure (see Bruce et
al., 2013, for more detailed information). Often the different meanings of
fractions are not made explicit to students; in general, instruction in North
American classrooms dwells particularly on the part-whole construct (Moseley & Okamoto, 2008; Moseley, 2005). Charalambous & Pitta-Pantazi (2007)
looked at differences in over 600 fifth- and sixth-grade student understanding
of each of the fractions subconstructs and how this understanding affected
student performance on operations with fractions as well as determining
fractional equivalents. Their findings show that students are most proficient in
part-whole subconstruct tasks and least proficient in measure-related tasks
such as comparing fractions, ordering fractions, placing fractions on number
lines and finding equivalent fractions using number lines (p. 302-304). This is
not surprising given the typically strong focus on the part-whole construct in
fraction teaching.</p>
<p>Student development of fractions subconstructs is a complex phenomenon. In
a qualitative study of sixth-grade students, Hackenburg and Tillema (2009)
recognize the changes in difficulty level of fraction multiplication questions;
difficulty depends on the type of fractions being multiplied (e.g., a unit
fraction vs. a proper fraction, and in which order they are multiplied –
calculating a unit fraction of a proper fraction or a proper fraction of a unit
fraction) (p. 16). </p>
<p>In their chapter, “Understanding Operations on Fractions and Decimals,”
Empson and Levi (2011) discuss the particular conceptual challenges students
face when learning multiplication and division of fractions. Multiplication and
division involve unfamiliar concepts when numbers involved in the question
are fractions (especially when a fraction is being multiplied by a fraction,
instead of a fraction by a whole number). Empson and Levi (2011) call these
types of questions “partial groups problems”, as the number of groups is a
fraction, or partial number, and not a whole number and, therefore, involves
different procedures than those students are familiar with in whole number
multiplication and division. When multiplying and dividing with partial
numbers, students must develop a conceptual understanding of new
algorithms. As Empson and Levi (2011) explain, “These problems pose new conceptual challenges, because they involve working with parts of parts and relating a part to two different units” (p. 189). One example these authors provide is the following problem: I have <abbr title=""><sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></abbr> of a bag of candy. A full bag of candy weighs <abbr title=""><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub></abbr> pound. How many pounds of candy do I have? To solve this
problem successfully, students need to cognitively consider <abbr title=""><sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></abbr> of <abbr title=""><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub></abbr> of 1
pound and the same amount of candy is both <abbr title=""><sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></abbr> of a bag and <abbr title=""><sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub></abbr> of a pound”
(p. 189). </p>
<p>Like Lamon (1999) and Empson & Levi (2011), Graeber and Tirosh (1990)
consider the conceptual misunderstandings and overgeneralizations that
students hold around multiplication and division. In the case of decimals for
example, which are deeply connected to fractions as another system for nonwhole
numbers, this international study (involving the United States and
Israel) revealed the assumptions that fourth and fifth graders brought to
multiplication and division with decimals. They identified the student notion
that multiplication always results in a bigger number and division in a smaller
number, as a problematic belief that impeded an accurate understanding of
decimals, and in turn, of fractions operations (Graeber & Tirosh, 1990). </p>
<p>Related to this misunderstanding is the challenge for students of managing
the nuanced meanings of mathematical notation, when some familiar
conventions with operations involving whole numbers suddenly mean
something different. For example, when multiplying whole numbers, the “x”
symbol is often interpreted as repeated addition, but when multiplying
fractions, it represents taking one amount “of” another (e.g., <abbr title=""><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub></abbr> of <abbr title=""><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub></abbr>). Student
learning and flexibility with these conventions presents a significant challenge
(Ott, 1990).</p>
<h3 id="" class="col-bl align-left">Longer term implications of student challenges with multiplication and division with fractions</h3>
<p>Many researchers have noted the widespread difficulty that students have in
attaining the concepts involved in multiplication and division with fractions
(Brown & Quinn, 2007; Empson & Levi, 2011), and emphasize that the lack of
conceptual understanding in this area has wide and serious implications that
extend to other areas of mathematics (Baroody & Hume, 1991). </p>
<p>One of the obvious long-term implications of student memorization of
algorithms without understanding is the potential of large and unreasonable
errors that go unchecked. Hasemann (1981) describes these computational
errors as “nonsensical results” (p. 81) attributable to a lack of reasoning or
meaning behind the algorithm. When students are able to understand the
underlying concepts, on the other hand, they are able to better handle
increasing complexity and to apply the reasoning behind the algorithm
flexibly and with greater accuracy (Baroody & Hume, 1991; Petit, Laird &
Marsden, 2010). </p>
<p>A second long-term implication is revealed by Brown and Quinn (2007), who
discuss the deep connections between fractions multiplication and division,
and algebra. Their study compared 191 students in the areas of algebra and
fractions competency. They found that student understanding of fraction
knowledge was clearly linked (statistically significant) to algebraic reasoning.
“Elementary algebra is built on a foundation of fundamental arithmetic
concepts” (p. 8). In other words, algebraic concepts are similar to and rely on
fractions concepts. The rational number system, for example, is introduced in
early algebra and draws upon an understanding of the common fraction (p.
8). When „shortcuts‟ such as to „simply cross multiply‟ when dividing fractions
are misunderstood or simply not connected to the reasoning of the actions,
students can have difficulty with more complex algebra later on. As Brown and Quinn state, “the list of algebraic generalisations that rely on fractional
constructs grows as students move to each subsequent level of mathematics”
(p. 8). These generalizations include combining like terms (either of a unit
fraction or of a variable) and multiplying by a constant to simplify (to either
clear a fraction‟s denominator or clear a variable). The implications of
experiencing problems in algebra are serious, as algebra has been identified
as a key precursor to later mathematics learning: “If algebra is for everyone,
then all students must first become familiar and fluent with fractions” (Brown
& Quinn, 2007, p. 12). Gaining a solid understanding of the connected
concepts and procedures related to multiplication and division with fractions
is, therefore, extremely important to later success in mathematics. </p>
<h2 id="" class="col-bl">5. Teaching Challenges</h2>
<p>There is a significant amount of content knowledge required in the successful
teaching of multiplication and division with fractions. Teachers themselves
must not only understand how to multiply and divide fractions (procedural
understanding), but they must have a sufficient conceptual understanding of
operations in order to successfully teach the concepts. Izsák (2008)
emphasizes the necessity of in-depth understanding of the content in order
to be able to respond flexibly and effectively to the great range of student
responses. Students benefit when teachers are able to adapt to a variety of
student needs: “teachers need to reason explicitly and flexibly with nested
levels of units if they are to respond to the variety of quantitative structures…
that their students might assemble” (p. 104). Izsák‟s study highlights the
importance of “explicit, flexible attention” (p. 139) to the range of student
responses and what these responses imply or foreshadow in terms of student
understanding or lack thereof. Given the systemic underdevelopment of
fractions understanding in students and adults in North America, it is not
surprising that teachers face tremendous challenges in responding flexibly and
effectively to the range of student needs.</p>
<h3 id="" class="col-bl center">Pre-service Teaching</h3>
<h3 id="" class="col-bl align-left">General Challenges</h3>
<p>Most of the research on teaching challenges related to multiplication and
division with fractions reports on issues that pre-service teachers face, and
that these issues are not unlike those of younger students. Graeber, Tirosh &
Glover (1989) found that pre-service teachers did, in fact, follow “primitive”
models of multiplication and division and experienced difficulties with
selecting the appropriate operation when solving word problems. A much
more recent study of pre-service elementary teachers‟ procedural and
conceptual knowledge of fractions in Flanders also found that the misconceptions and understandings of teachers mirror those of elementary
school students (Van Steenbrugge, Lesage, Valcke & Desoete, 2014). In
general, pre-service teachers‟ knowledge of fractions was limited: teachers in
both the first year and third year of their program made many errors when
tested on procedural and conceptual knowledge of fractions in this study. The
authors argue that their work “provides ground to address teachers‟
preparation as an effective way to increase standards expected of students
[student teachers]” (p. 156). </p>
<h3 id="" class="col-bl align-left">Lack of Understanding of a Fraction as a Number</h3>
<p>Another particular similarity between student and pre-service teacher gaps in
understanding appears to rest with understanding fractions as quantities. In
their study of pre-service teachers, Park, Güçler & McCrory (2013) review
literature on K-8 students, and note that both K-8 students and pre-service
teachers have difficulty “conceiving of fractions as numbers as an extension of
whole numbers…” (p. 458). In the analysis of lessons and resulting student
concept attainment, the study showed that, “key mathematical aspects of
fraction, including fraction-as-number, were not explicitly addressed” (p. 475).
It was assumed that fraction-as-number was already understood by preservice
teachers, and was therefore not addressed in the mathematics courses.
The authors argue the importance of being “aware that understanding
fractions as numbers is not trivial either to mathematicians in the past or to
today‟s K-8 students” (p. 477). </p>
<h3 id="" class="col-bl align-left">Lack of Concept Understanding</h3>
<p>Many studies that examine pre-service teachers‟ mathematical content
knowledge demonstrate that this knowledge may be insufficient for effective
teaching of multiplication and division with fractions (Izsák, 2008; Lubinski, Fox
& Thomason, 1998; Olanoff, 2011; Ball, 1990; Tobias, Olanoff and Lo, 2012). In
their review of fractions research, Tobias, Olanoff and Lo (2012) found that pre-service teachers had an underdeveloped proficiency in fractions, and in
later algebra (p. 668). In particular, the studies reviewed by Tobias, Olanoff
and Lo (2012) demonstrate that pre-service teachers tend to: “have a rulebased
conception of fraction multiplication and division” (p. 671); and have
“misconceptions [that] result from overgeneralized rules from other number
systems, such as multiplication always makes bigger, or result from not
understanding algorithms for multiplying and dividing fractions” (p. 671). In
their study of Taiwanese pre-service teachers‟ knowledge of fractions, Huang,
Liu & Lin (2008) also found that these aspiring teachers showed better
understanding of fractions procedures than fractions concepts, and had the
most difficulty with operations (multiplication and division). Similarly, Forrester
and Chinnappan (2010) found that pre-service teachers in Australia mainly
relied on procedures rather than conceptual understanding, which led to
errors of their own, as well as an inability to catch and correct student errors.</p>
<h3 id="" class="col-bl align-left">Challenges of Division with Fractions</h3>
<p>Newton (2008) found that student teachers “were most uncertain about
dividing fractions, followed by subtracting, multiplying, and adding fractions”
(p. 1100). Other researchers have attempted to delve into this phenomenon to
investigate further the particular difficulty with division with fractions. Ball
(1990), for example, interviewed prospective teachers to assess their
understanding of division by zero (e.g., 7 ÷ 0 = ?) and division of fractions in
algebraic equations. Many of the pre-service teachers were able to arrive at
correct answers, but few could explain the foundational principals and
meanings of division. Qualitative data in the study highlighted gaps in content
knowledge; one teacher candidate “seemed to get stuck by his knowledge of
the algorithm „invert and multiply‟” (p. 136); another explained “that she
hadn‟t done this since high school” (p. 136). Ball conjectured that “The
prospective teachers‟ knowledge of division seemed founded more on
memorization than on conceptual understanding. Some of the teacher candidates could not remember the rules at all… Sheer memorization serves well to display mathematical knowledge in school – until one forgets, that is” (p. 141-142). </p>
<p>To identify the precise issues pre-service teachers were having with the
division operation of fractions, Isik & Kar (2012) conducted a case study
analysis of error type among pre-service elementary mathematics teachers in
Turkey. Seven types of errors were identified: unit confusion; assigning natural
number interpretations to fractions; problems using ratio proportions; being
unable to establish part-whole relationships; dividing by the denominator of
the divisor; using multiplication instead of division; and increasing errors by
inverting and multiplying the divisor fraction (p. 2-7). Further, the pre-service
teachers in the study lacked sufficient understanding to pose division of
fractions problems that would benefit student learning, and may even have
further contributed to student challenges. Given the abundance of research
on pre-service teacher understanding of fractions, it is highly likely that
increased attention on fractions understanding in teacher education programs
would benefit these aspiring teachers and their future students (Luo, Lo &
Leu, 2011; Lin et al., 2013). </p>
<h3 id="" class="col-bl center">In-service Teaching</h3>
<p>Research on in-service teachers was far less abundant compared to that of
pre-service teachers and suggests that there is a need for additional studies
that identify the role and impact of in-service-level professional learning
programs on teacher content understanding and related teaching practices.
One small but hopeful study (Flores, Turner & Bachmann, 2005) of two inservice
teachers focused on building teacher conceptual understanding of
division with fractions and resulted in the development of a very precise
sequence of types of fractions division questions to use with students. </p>
<p>Although it is unclear as to whether this sequence has been field-tested more
widely, it is worthy of consideration: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Use fractions with the same denominator, so that the first is
bigger than the second, and the quotient is a whole number;
for example, <abbr title=""><sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub></abbr> ÷ <abbr title=""><sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub></abbr></li>
  <li>With the same conditions, but the quotient does not have to
be a whole number: <abbr title=""><sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub></abbr> ÷ <abbr title=""><sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub></abbr></li>
  <li>Use fractions that do not have the same denominator but that
are well known, are related, and have common factors, such as <abbr title=""><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub></abbr> ÷ <abbr title=""><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></abbr>, and <abbr title=""><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub></abbr> ÷ <abbr title=""><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub></abbr>. With these examples, we want the children to find, by using manipulatives, the common denominator. What smaller piece will fit into the two fractions?</li>
<li>Now with more difficult examples, as with <abbr title=""><sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub></abbr> ÷ <abbr title=""><sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></abbr>. They also
need to be able to find the common denominator.</li>
<li>Ask students how we obtain the answer, look at the numbers,
and search for patterns and similarities: <div class="center"><img src="/images/pdf-img/multDivNew1.png" alt=""/></div>They are multiples/factors</li>
<li>Look at the original problem <abbr title=""><sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub></abbr> ÷ <abbr title=""><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></abbr> (multiplying by 4)… <br>Explain why the algorithm works.”</li>

with Fractions</h2>
<p>Although there is a limited amount of published research on teacher
knowledge of multiplication and division of fractions, there is a more robust
literature on best practices. Effective strategies for teaching described in the
research literature clustered around six key areas, as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Increase the focus on conceptual understanding;</li>
  <li>Recognize and draw on students‟ informal knowledge and prior
experiences;</li>
  <li>Draw on student familiarity with whole number operations;</li>
  <li>Include multiple representations to convey meaning;</li>

<p>Each of these themes is elaborated upon in the discussion below.</p>
<h3 id="" class="col-bl center">Effective teaching of fractions operations includes an increased focus on conceptual understanding</h3>
<p>Research shows that student learning in multiplication and division with
fractions benefits from attention to conceptual understanding before or in
conjunction with algorithms (Baroody and Hume, 1991; Li, 2008; Petit, Laird &
Marsden, 2010; Phillip, 2000; Rule & Hallagan, 2006): “Students need to
develop number and operation sense before learning how to apply these
terms through procedures, understanding what the problem means, rather
than merely computing an answer” (Rule & Hallagan, 2006, p. 3). Li (2008) reiterates
that it is not enough to teach only the invert-and-multiply algorithm
when teaching division of fractions; it is necessary for students to understand concepts beyond memorizing the rote calculations. In Li‟s Chinese textbook
example, students are introduced to the meaning of fraction division (e.g., “as
the inverse operation of fraction multiplication through a discussion of three
related word problems”) before being taught the algorithm (p. 549).</p>
<p>Baroody and Hume (1991) offer a developmental perspective to instruction
that draws on student strengths and prior knowledge and focuses on
meaning and understanding. They report that instruction should focus on:
understanding, informal knowledge, purposeful learning, reflection and
discussion (pp. 55-56). When learning fractions operations, Baroody and
Hume (1991) suggest starting with context problems, so students can focus
on what they are solving instead of how they are solving. When solving
problems, it is also important for students to use appropriate manipulatives,
such as pattern blocks, Cuisinaire rods and paper folding – hands on
experiences which help to develop conceptual understanding. (See Rule &
Hallagan, 2006, for example.)</p>
<p>Based on the authors‟ previous Foundations to Learning and Teaching
Fractions: Addition and Subtraction Literature Review (see Bruce et al. 2013),
an increased focus on understanding should include explicit teaching of the
different meanings of fractions beyond part-whole relationships (to include
the part-part, quotient, linear measurement and operator meanings of
fractions). The findings of Hasemann (1981) and Charalambous & Pitta-Pantazi
(2007) concur and “suggest that a profound understanding of the different
interpretations of fractions can uplift students‟ performance on tasks related
to the operations of fractions and to fraction equivalence” (Charalambous &
Pitta-Pantazi 2007, p. 311). In other words, Charalambous and Pitta-Pantazi
are recommending that a solid foundation in developing understanding of the
multiple meanings of fractions (as listed above) enables and fosters
understanding of what it means to operate on and manipulate fractions.</p>
<h3 id="" class="col-bl center">Effective teaching of multiplication and division with fractions recognizes and draws on students’ informal knowledge with fractions as well as prior
knowledge and experiences</h3>
<p>Informal knowledge is prior, “real-life circumstantial” knowledge that a student
can draw upon when solving problems (Mack, 1990, p. 16). Studies show that
students do indeed have informal knowledge of fractions, but that they lack
an understanding of algorithmic procedures and fraction symbols (p. 29). “The
results add more evidence to the argument in favor of teaching concepts
prior to procedure” (Mack, 1990, p. 30). Mack (2001) considered ways to build
on fifth grade students‟ informal knowledge of multiplication with fractions.
Partitioning and unit fractions are two examples of prior knowledge identified
in the study. Students benefit from having a flexible understanding of the unit
and determining what constitutes the whole when learning to multiply
fractions and thinking about finding “a part of a part of a whole” (p. 269). The
fifth graders in Mack‟s study (2001) also continuously drew upon their
knowledge of partitioning when they worked on solving increasingly complex
multiplication problems. Students reconceptualized and partitioned units to
reflect the different multiplication problems they were given and adjusted
their strategies based on the “relationship they perceived between the
denominator of the multiplier and the numerator of the multiplicand” (p. 292).
Naiser, Wright & Capraro (2004) report on their study of activating student
prior knowledge, reviewing and practicing problems, and making real-world
connections (p. 195) to increase student engagement and motivation. The
student gains were attributed to the use of manipulatives and efforts to
facilitate student construction of their own content knowledge. </p>
<p>According to Flores (2002), making connections amongst mathematics ideas
and understanding multiple meanings of fractions are key to developing a
profound understanding of division with fractions. Flores concludes that
educators can help students by connecting division with fractions to other mathematical concepts, like ratio, reciprocals, inverse operations,
multiplication, proportional reasoning and algebra. Inevitably, students
approach division of fractions with previous knowledge of division, and it is
important to optimize this prior knowledge. Equivalent fractions, multiplication
and division of whole numbers, and multiplication of fractions are identified,
by Flores, as important areas to draw upon. </p>
<h3 id="" class="col-bl center">Effective teaching of fractions multiplication and division should build from student familiarity with whole number operations</h3>
<p>Petit, Laird and Marsden (2010) note that connections to prior knowledge
about whole number operations can be powerful for students during
instruction on multiplication and division with fractions. While operations with
fractions certainly carry “new and different interpretations” compared with
operations with whole numbers (Wu, 2001, p. 174), many processes that apply
to whole numbers do still apply to fractions. The examples given by Petit,
Laird and Marsden (2010) include the fact that one times a number will equal
that number; 0 times a number will equal zero; and that multiplication and
division are the inverse of each other. Specifically, students should “interact
with a variety of situations and contexts that include both partitive and
quotative division, and different kinds of remainder” (p. 178)</p>
<h3 id="" class="col-bl">Multiplication</h3>
<p>Being able to see multiplication with fractions as an extension of whole
number multiplication is important to student success (Wu, 2001). In their
case study, Vale and Davies (2007) discuss the connection between
multiplication, division and developing an understanding of fractions,
proportions and ratio. They highlight multiplicative thinking as a necessary
foundation to solving fraction problems. Setting up array formations and grids
for whole number multiplication and division are directly linked to using area models and grids for calculating fraction multiplication and division. The area
model of multiplication provides a visual and allows connections to be made
between whole number multiplication and fraction multiplication, and also
helps to explain why multiplication of fractions results in a smaller number
(Wu, 2001). The common approach to multiplication draws upon repeatedaddition,
a well-known strategy for whole number multiplication that is more
difficult to apply to fraction multiplication (e.g., when thinking about <abbr title=""><sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></abbr> x <abbr title=""><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></abbr>, it is hard to imagine adding <abbr title=""><sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></abbr> to itself <abbr title=""><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></abbr> times).</p>
<p>Tsankova and Pjanic (2009) also discuss the area model of multiplication as an
effective way of linking multiplication with fractions to whole number
multiplication: “the concept of multiplication applied in finding the area of a
rectangle connects with the prior understanding that students have about
multiplying natural numbers” (p. 284). Considering the overlapping parts of an
area model as well as folding paper and using number lines are helpful
strategies for multiplying fractions (p. 282-283). </p>
<h3 id="" class="col-bl">Division</h3>
<p>Although division with fractions is significantly different than division with
whole numbers (see Section 2: Conceptual Underpinnings for Multiplication
and Division with Fractions), according to Kribs-Zaleta (2008), building on
knowledge of division of whole numbers can also help build understanding of
division with fractions. In fact, Sidney and Alibali (2012) found that relating the
abstract division structure used in whole number division was more beneficial
to student learning of division with fractions than was relating knowledge of
other fraction operations. The measurement model (repeated subtraction),
which allows you to make as many groups as possible when the size of the
group is known, and partitive division (fair sharing), which helps you divide
items among a known number of groups are two such examples of whole
number division models. Kribs-Zaleta (2008) worked with a group of sixth graders and found that cutting up oranges and using containers of lemonade
proved helpful in illustrating models for division of fractions. The following
explains the solution process seen in the study:</p>
<p><i>Consider the following problem when working through the following steps for
measurement division: There are 3 meters of ribbon. Each decoration needs <abbr title=""><sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub></abbr> of a meter of ribbon. How many decorations can you make? </i></p>
<p>For measurement division problems… most solutions involved a twostep
process:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Subdivide the dividend into units of the given denominator
(e.g.,fifths).</li>
  <li>Group the new pieces according to the numerator (e.g., two).
Solutions to the partitive problems also tended to involve two steps,
but here the order was reversed…</li>
</ol>
<p>Solutions to the partitive problems also tended to involve two steps,
but here the order was reversed…</p>
<ol>
  <li>Partition the dividend into as many groups as the numerator (e.g.,
two</li>
  <li>Build as many of the groups created above as the denominator (e.g.,
five). (Kribs-Zaleta, 2008, p. 455)</li>
</ol>
<p>The following sample of student thinking demonstrates the strategy outlined
above for measurement division problems. The student has constructed the
three meters of ribbon, partitioned each meter into fifths and then grouped
into two-fifths to determine the number of groups.</p>

<p>An effective way of helping students understand the invert-and-multiply
algorithm is to relate it directly to commonly taught whole number division
interpretations: sharing and measurement. The following table is taken from
Siebert (2002) and outlines how each of these models can explain why inverting the second fraction and multiplying makes sense for fraction
division. </p>

<p>Li (2008) also summarizes the meaning of the division as “the same as the
meaning of “division of whole numbers.” It is an inverse operation of
multiplication; that is, given the product of two numbers and one of these
two numbers, find the other number” (p. 548). Put another way, he explains
that, “Consistent with the approach to division of whole numbers, division of
fractions is explained as a method for figuring out the number of times that a
divisor can be measured out of the dividend” (p. 548). Two helpful diagrams
show these connections between division with fractions and division with
whole numbers. </p>

<h3 id="" class="col-bl">Effective teaching includes multiple and carefully selected representations for multiplying and dividing fractions</h3>
<p>After working with a group of teachers, Peck and Wood (2008) recognized the
importance of being able to teach – and respond to – a variety of
representations in mathematics: “Students and teachers alike must be able to explain the mathematics and express the situation with symbols, charts,
graphs, and diagrams, which are all ways of communicating mathematically”
(p. 210). Equal groups, multiplicative comparison, repeatedsubtraction/measurement,
and fair-sharing/partitioning are all classifications
for representing multiplication and division of fractions that are discussed by
Peck and Wood (2008). In increasing their own flexibility with representations,
teachers are better able to teach their students a variety of ways to solve
problems in mathematics (Peck & Wood, 2008). Of equal importance is the
careful selection of representations that are appropriate to the context of the
problem. </p>
<p>In an effort to help teachers understand both how and why fraction division
works, Cengiz and Rathouz (2011) suggest using stories, diagrams and
symbols to: (i) see characteristics of each type of fraction operation; (iI)
recognize differences between them; and, (iii) develop an understanding of
when, and in which context, to use each of them. The authors reported on
two teachers engaged in challenging fractions tasks where they had to move
between representations (from “stories to diagrams and symbols” and from
“symbols to stories and diagrams”), a helpful strategy in making sense of
division with fractions. The authors suggest that activities be selected to
provide experiences which help build the concept of the unit and connect
representations. </p>
<p>Consider the following example, where a story is represented first as a
diagram and then as symbols:</p>
<table class="tbl-black">

    <tr>
      <td>Story</td>
      <td>George has driven 2<abbr title=""><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub></abbr> kilometers to get to his sister‟s house, but that he is only <abbr title=""><sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></abbr> of the way. How many kilometers is the total distance to his sister‟s house?</td>

      <td>To find out how far the extra <abbr title=""><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></abbr> 
of the way is:
<ul>
  <li>• Divide <abbr title=""><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></abbr> of the way (2<abbr title=""><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub></abbr> km) by 3 to get the distance for <abbr title=""><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></abbr>.

<p>*Note: dividing by 3 and multiply by 4 is the same as solving 2<abbr title=""><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub></abbr> x <abbr title=""><sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub></abbr> (i.e., multiplying by the reciprocal of <abbr title=""><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub></abbr>)</p>

<p>(Reproduced from from Cengiz & Rathouz, 2011, p. 151)</p>
<p>Cengiz and Rathouz (2011) also draw our attention to the importance of
tracking the unit when solving fraction problems and to recognize the
relationship between, and roles of, the numerator and denominator. For
example, in the case of 6 ÷ <abbr title=""><sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub></abbr>, it is helpful to think both in terms of the unit fraction (<abbr title=""><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub></abbr>), and to recognize that the numerator indicates “the number of
groups shown” (2) and the denominator identifies “the number of equal
groups in the whole batch” (5) (p. 148). Such “problems that require students
to consider both division interpretations, attend to appropriate referent units,
and form connections among representations promote a foundation for
understanding fraction division” (p. 152). </p>
<p>Tools that prove particularly helpful for student learning include the number
line as well as paper folding. In a study of multiplication with fractions
conducted with Grade 6 students, Wyberg, Whitney, Cramer, Monson &
Leavitt (2011) discuss the benefits of paper folding and number lines as
helpful tools in multiplying fractions and highlight the importance of models that connect symbols and contexts. In this teaching experiment study, paper
folding and the number line helped sixth grade students gain understanding
beyond the fraction multiplication algorithm which, despite being a relatively
simple procedure, is often not well conceptualized. “The paper model clearly
showed students that the product of two fractions less than 1 is less than
both fractions in the problem” (p. 292). In their study, “Many of the students
explained that they knew they had the correct answer when the folded paper,
the results of the algorithm, and the drawing of the number line all matched”
(p. 294).</p>

Noparit and Saengpun (2013) consider the number line as a tool to teach
multiplication and division of fractions in Japan. Two teacher candidates and
their grade six students participated in lesson study focusing on multiplying
and dividing fractions. Lessons used by the teacher candidates were based on
Japanese textbooks and the proportional number line was used as a tool to
help students and teachers interpret and solve problems. The number line
representation helped students think about fraction calculations in several
different ways, and they made connections between them. Both students and
their teachers had a more developed understanding of the calculations they
were doing when they used the proportional number line as a tool. </p>
<p>The number line (along with unit fractions and paper folding) also emerged as
key tools for learning operations with fractions in a detailed study conducted
by Keijzer and Terwell (2001). Similarly, in a study by Siegler, Thompson and
Scheider (2011) that examined connections between whole number and
fraction development in twenty-four 11- and twenty-four 13-year-olds, the
“mental number line” was a helpful tool for students to use when learning to
understand fractions magnitudes. In number line tasks that included placing
fractions and whole numbers on number lines to compare magnitude, the
researchers also concluded that “Emphasizing that fractions are measurements
of quantity might improve learning about fractions" (p. 293).</p>
<p>De Castro (2008) examined the role of cognitive models as the “missing link”
to the learning of fraction multiplication and division with two sections of prehigh
school students in the Bridge Program (where the students could receive
additional help in math, science and English before entering high school). The
students in this study initially expressed negative attitudes about learning
fractions. However, using the models presented in the table below, students,
who had prior knowledge of the cancel-and-multiply and invert-and-multiply
procedures were able to make sense of what they were doing. “The use of
cognitive models helped students understand the algorithm better and relate
it to their schema, thus achieving greater retention.” (p. 109) (As researchers
ourselves, we can see how these models may be helpful. However, it is easy
to anticipate a criticism that these too could become overly procedural, and
caution that use of models should include opportunities for students to
engage in creation of the models and meaning-making, through open
problems, exploration and inquiry.)</p>

<h3 id="" class="col-bl align-left">Specific suggestions for understanding multiplication with fractions</h3>
<p>Multiplication is a complex operation. Depending on the size of the mutiplier,
multiplication may result in increased, decreased or preserved quantities. Azim
(2002) found that students perceive multiplication as either repeated addition
of whole numbers or division (fractions), depending on whether the quantity
increases or decreases in size, respectively. Azim identified a number of
methods that help develop an understanding of multiplication, in all its forms.
Making real-life connections, for example, to photocopying (where a
photocopier can preserve, reduce or enlarge an image, depending on the
multiplier) or increasing/decreasing fractional recipe amounts can help
students conceptualize how the multiplication of fractions will result in a
smaller quantity.</p>
<p>As previously discussed, we know that based on early experience of
operations with whole numbers, students tend to persist in a strongly held
belief and overgeneralization that addition and multiplication operations
always produce a larger total or quantity, and when you subtract or divide,
you get a smaller quantity. Graeber and Campbell (1993) reported on student
misconceptions and provided suggestions for helping students figure out how
the opposite can be true, in the case of multiplying and dividing fractions. </p>
<p>One of the common interpretations of multiplication – repeated addition –
does not lend itself well to the multiplication of rational numbers (e.g., mixed
numbers, proper fractions or decimals). Therefore, students should have more
of a sense of multiplication than just repeated addition. The area model of
multiplication is helpful for seeing how “multiplication makes smaller.” When
two fractions of an area are laid on top of each other, the overlapping section
is the answer. This is very similar to the explanation provided in Section 2 of
this literature review, which discusses the concept of „shared space‟ and has
proven to be a particularly powerful representation for helping teachers and
students make sense of fraction multiplication. </p>
<div class="center"><img src="/images/pdf-img/multDiv36.png" alt=""/></div>
<p>In an area model, one factor describes the width of a rectangle, the other
factor describes the length of the rectangle. </p>
<p>The product is modeled by the area. </p>
<p>a) Area model for 3 x 2 and 4 x 5</p>
<div class="center"><img src="/images/pdf-img/multDiv37.png" alt=""/></div>
<p>b) Area model for 0.5 x 0.5 is 0.25 </p>
<div class="center"><img src="/images/pdf-img/multDiv38.png" alt=""/></div>
<p>(Reproduced from Graeber & Campbell, 1993, p. 409)</p>
<p>Another strategy in understanding how fraction multiplication results in a
smaller quantity is to identify the pattern in a list of multiplication facts
beginning with whole numbers and then continuing to fractions less than 1
(i.e., 3x10, 2x10, 1x10, 0x10, <abbr title=""><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub></abbr>x10, etc.) and recognize that not all of these
results in a bigger number (Graeber & Campbell, 1993).</p>
<h3 id="" class="col-bl align-left">Specific suggestions for understanding division with fractions</h3>
<p>The measurement model can help students make sense of “division making
bigger,” even before considering formal algorithms for fraction division.
Graeber and Campbell (1993) suggest that “fraction pieces, drawings, or their
[students‟] knowledge of the monetary system” are helpful in solving division
problems and using rational numbers that result in the answer being made
bigger (p. 410).</p>
<p>The measurement model and the repeated-subtraction model prove useful in
eliminating fraction division misconceptions. “The measurement model can be
used to reveal the relationship between the answer and the divisor. This
model can also build connections with other concepts and models, such as
the division algorithm, remainders, and the missing-factor approach”
(Coughlin, 2010, p. 283). Using repeated subtraction, as shown in the below
figure, better highlights the relationship between the answer and the divisor
than simply solving with the invert-and-multiply rule. </p>
<p>When calculating <abbr title=""><sup>12</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub></abbr> ÷ 2, the <abbr title=""><sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub></abbr> left over from the subtraction is <abbr title=""><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub></abbr> of the 2-unit (or <abbr title=""><sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub></abbr> - unit) block.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="/images/pdf-img/multDiv39.png" alt=""/></div>
<p>For 1<abbr title=""><sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></abbr> ÷ <abbr title=""><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub></abbr>, repeated subtraction demonstrates that the remainder is <abbr title=""><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></abbr> of a <abbr title=""><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub></abbr>-unit block.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="/images/pdf-img/multDiv40.png" alt=""/></div>
<p>(Reproduced from Coughlin, 2010, p. 285)</p>
<p>Unpacking a conceptual lesson on dividing fractions, Philipp (2000) also
advocates for a measurement approach, arguing that it is “difficult to
conceptualize 1 ÷ <abbr title=""><sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub></abbr> using a partitive model. How might we share a cup of sugar among <abbr title=""><sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub></abbr> people? For fraction situations, it is often more meaningful to use a measurement model: If we had 1 cup of sugar and each recipe called for <abbr title=""><sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub></abbr> cup of sugar, then how many recipes could we bake?” (p. 11).</p>
<h2 id="" class="col-bl">7. Recommendations</h2>
<p>Although the body of research on multiplication and division with fractions is
substantially smaller than that for general fractions research, there are some
clear directions for future activity based on this literature review. The
recommendations are classified into two broad categories: recommendations
for supporting high quality teaching of fractions operations, and recommendations for supporting high quality research on fractions operations.</p>
<h3 id="" class="col-bl align-left">Supporting High Quality Teaching of Fractions Operations</h3>
<p>Just as there are recommendations for improving the teaching of fractions,
there are also recommendations for improving the research on multiplication
and division with fractions. These include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>• Supporting and implementing additional and more robust research at
the in-service level where the literature is relatively sparse.</li>
<li>• Continuing to develop the Fractions Learning Pathways Framework to
include multiplication and division with fractions, and continue
developing field-testing and disseminating accessible high caliber
resources for teachers related to the Fractions Learning Pathways
Framework.</li>
<li>• Engaging in more research on effective teaching of multiplication and
division with fractions, including seeking answers to questions such as
the following:
<ul>
  <li>• How can we tap into students‟ informal knowledge and early
strategies with fair sharing to help them build deep conceptual
understanding that later increases understanding of more
formalized fractions operations?</li>
<li>• How can the unit fraction help with the teaching and learning of
multiplication and division of fractions? How can unit fractions
help students to understand equivalent fractions and common
denominators (which are central to multiplication and division
with fractions)? </li>
<li>• Which types of tasks, contexts and representations support
Ontario students most effectively in developing their
understanding of multiplication and division with fractions?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To pursue any of the above recommendations for research, once again,
partnerships will be central to success. Researchers, teachers, and
mathematics leaders would benefit from working together to gain clear
and well-informed answers to some of these questions.</p>
