            <p>Dear Ms. Fraction,</p>
            <p>In class yesterday Devon created the fraction 3/8 for the shapes we were given. The only way I could see that fraction was by considering the fraction of the shapes that had four sides but Devon said she looked at shapes that have four or more sides and are shaded in. I thought you could only consider one characteristic when creating a fraction, such as shape, and not two, such as shape and colour. Can you help me understand what Devon is thinking?</p>
