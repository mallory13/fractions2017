                Teacher: â€¦ somehow show, if this was your number line at the bottom across your desk, at the bottom,
                if you think about the area or the space that your whole desk covers as the whole, could you somehow show
                one of the adults or your partner, what half of your desk is? So cover up or show what half of your desk is.
                And then an adult may ask you to explain what you are thinking.

                Student 1: What we did was we went a different way on our desk and we figured out that, and we knew that zero and the
                three thirds were here so we put zero at the left side and then we put the whole at the right side. And then we figured out,
                because it is a smaller length on the side of the desk than the other way of the desk, then we have to put it different sizes
                in between the whole and the zero.
