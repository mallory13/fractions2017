            <p>In K through Grade3, students develop their understanding of fraction through:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>• dividing whole objects and sets of objects into equal-sized parts and naming using fractional names</li>
              <li>• comparing common fractional areas (e.g., one-half and one-fourth)</li>
              <li>• composing fractional values by combining fractional pieces</li>

              <li>• represent fractions using concrete materials, words, and standard fractional notation, and explain the meaning of the denominator as the number of the fractional parts of a whole or a set, and the numerator as the number of
                fractional parts being considered;</li>
              <li>• compare and order fractions (i.e., halves, thirds, fourths, fifths, tenths) by considering the size and the number of fractional parts (e.g., <abbr title="Four Fifths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>4</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>5</sub></span></abbr>
                is greater than <abbr title="Three Fifths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>3</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>5</sub></span></abbr> because there are more parts in <abbr title="Four Fifhts" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>4</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>5</sub></span></abbr>;
                <abbr title="One Quarter" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>4</sub></span></abbr> is greater than <abbr title="One Fifth" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>5</sub></span></abbr>
                because the size of the part is larger in <abbr title="One Quarter" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>4</sub></span></abbr>);</li>
              <li>• compare fractions to the benchmarks of 0, <abbr title="One Half" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>2</sub></span></abbr> and 1 ( e.g., <abbr title="One Eighth" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>8</sub></span></abbr>
                is closer to 0 than <abbr title="One Half" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>2</sub></span></abbr>; <abbr title="Three Fifths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>3</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>5</sub></span></abbr>
                is more than <abbr title="One Half" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>2</sub></span></abbr>);</li>
              <li>• demonstrate and explain the relationship between equivalent fractions, using concrete materials (e.g., fraction circles, fraction strips, pattern blocks) and drawings;</li>
              <li>• count forward by halves, thirds, fourths, and tenths to beyond one whole, using concrete materials and number lines (e.g., use fraction circles to count fourths: “One fourth, two fourths, three fourths, four fourths, five
                fourths, six fourths, …”);</li>
              <li>• determine and explain, through investigation, the relationship between fractions (i.e., halves, fifths, tenths) and decimals to tenths, using a variety of tools (e.g., concrete materials, drawings, calculators) and strategies
                (e.g., decompose <abbr title="Two Fifths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>2</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>5</sub></span></abbr> into <abbr title="Four Tenths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>4</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>10</sub></span></abbr>
                by dividing each fifth into two equal part to show that <abbr title="Two Fifths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>2</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>5</sub></span></abbr> can be represented as 0.4).</li>

                standard fractional notation;</li>
              <li>• demonstrate and explain the concept of equivalent fractions, using concrete materials (e.g., use fraction strips to show that <abbr title="Three Quarters" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>3</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>4</sub></span></abbr>
                is equal to <abbr title="Nine Twelfths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>9</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>12</sub></span></abbr>);</li>
              <li>• describe multiplicative relationships between quantities by using simple fractions and decimals (e.g., “If you have 4 plums and I have 6 plums, I can say that I have 1 <abbr title="One Half" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>2</sub></span></abbr>)
                or 1.5 times as many plums as you have.”);</li>
              <li>• determine and explain, through investigation using concrete materials, drawings, and calculators, the relationship between fractions (i.e., with denominators of 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, and 100) and their equivalent decimal forms
                (e.g., use a 10 x 10 grid to show that <abbr title="Two Fifths" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>2</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>5</sub></span></abbr> = <abbr title="Fourty One-Hundredth" class="abbr-frac"><span class="frac"><sup>40</sup><span>&frasl;</span><sub>100</sub></span></abbr>,
                which can also be represented as 0.4);</li>
              <li>• demonstrate an understanding of simple multiplicative relationships involving whole-number rates, through investigation using concrete materials and drawings (Sample problem: If 2 books cost $6, how would you calculate the cost
                of 8 books?).</li>
